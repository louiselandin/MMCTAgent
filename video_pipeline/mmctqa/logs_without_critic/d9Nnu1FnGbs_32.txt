User Input:
Tell me the sequence in which color of the logo on robot's chest changes through the video?
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The user is asking about the sequence of color changes in the logo on a robot's chest throughout the video. This question requires both visual analysis and temporal tracking, as we need to observe the robot's chest logo at different times in the video.",
"Thought": "Since the question is about visual information, the transcript is unlikely to provide the answer. However, as per the guidelines, we should always start with getting the transcript to understand the overall context of the video.",

"Thought": "We need to analyze these timestamps using the query_GPT4_Vision tool to understand the color of the logo at these moments. We will start with the first timestamp, 00:03:03, and ask the tool to describe the color of the logo on the robot's chest.",
