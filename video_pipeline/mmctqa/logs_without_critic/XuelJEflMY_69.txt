{
"Observation": "The transcript of the video is empty, which means the video does not contain any spoken words or the audio is not clear enough to be transcribed.",
"Thought": "Since the transcript is empty, I need to analyze the visuals of the video to answer the user's question. I will use the query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool to find the moment when the person starts writing in the video.",
