{"Output": "In the sequence of frames you provided, here is what happens as the lightning strikes:\n\n1. The first frame shows Spider-Man holding onto a pole with a dark figure at the forefront.\n2. The next frame shows the same dark figure, seemingly leaping down next to a building with a fenced area.\n3. The third frame captures a moment of dramatic action, where this dark figure appears to be in battle, surrounded by an energetic burst of blue electric bolts indicating the lightning strike.\n4. Directly following, the fourth frame intensifies this event; the figure seems to absorb or channel the electrical energy, almost at the center of the lightning's impact, which creates a large, dark explosion-like area amidst the lightning.\n5. The sequence continues with a cityscape shot showing lightning striking down upon a building from the sky\u2014this is the direct event of the lightning striking the building.\n6. Two frames appear identical, showcasing the cityscape right before or after the lightning strike without any visible change \u2014 these may belong to frames immediately before or after the strike.\n7. Next, there is a completely black frame, potentially representing a momentary blackout or a transition between scenes due to the lightning strike.\n8. The sequence concludes with two frames showing the after-effects of the strike. First, a zoomed-in shot that reveals bright, animated bolts of lightning.\n9. Lastly, there is an image enveloped in electric energy, resembling a creature or character, overwhelmed by or emanating a strong electrical force, likely as a consequence of the lightning strike.\n\nThe detailed depiction of the lightning and its immediate effects suggests a significant event in the narrative, possibly a pivotal moment for the character in the midst of the action, perhaps gaining new powers or being defeated by the strike."}

It seems that a dark figure, possibly a character in the video, is in the vicinity of the building when the lightning strikes.
