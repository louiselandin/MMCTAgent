User Input:
What is the shape of the dish, used to keep powdered bicarbonate in?
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The user is asking about the shape of a specific dish used to hold powdered bicarbonate in the video. To answer this question, I need to find the part of the video where the dish is shown and then analyze the visuals to determine the shape of the dish.",
"Thought": "Since the user's question is about a visual detail, the transcript might not contain this information. However, it's still worth checking the transcript first to see if there's any mention of the dish or the powdered bicarbonate. If the transcript doesn't provide the answer, I'll need to use the visual analysis tools to find the relevant part of the video and determine the shape of the dish.",

GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The transcript of the video is empty. This means that the video does not contain any spoken words or the audio was not transcribed.",
"Thought": "Since the transcript is empty, I cannot use it to find any information about the dish. Therefore, I need to use the visual analysis tools to find the part of the video where the dish with powdered bicarbonate is shown. I will use the query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool with a query related to 'powdered bicarbonate' to find the relevant frames.",

Tool Output:
{"Output": "00:01:00, 00:01:58, 00:00:48"}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool has returned three timestamps: 00:01:00, 00:01:58, and 00:00:48. These timestamps represent the top three frames that match with the query 'powdered bicarbonate'.",
"Thought": "I will now use the query_GPT4_Vision tool to analyze the visuals at these timestamps. I will start with the highest match, which is the timestamp at 00:01:00. I will ask the tool to describe the shape of the dish in the frames around this timestamp.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_GPT4_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"timestamp": "00:01:00",
"query": "These are the still frames from a short video clip. Can you describe the shape of the dish that contains the powdered bicarbonate?"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "The dish has a square shape."}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The query_GPT4_Vision tool has analyzed the frames around the timestamp 00:01:00 and has determined that the dish containing the powdered bicarbonate has a square shape.",
"Thought": "The tool's output directly answers the user's question. Therefore, I can now provide the answer to the user.",
"Answer": "The dish used to keep powdered bicarbonate in the video has a square shape."
