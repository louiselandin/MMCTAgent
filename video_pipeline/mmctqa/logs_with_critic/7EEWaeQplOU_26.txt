User Input:
From which side is the box entering into the video, left or right?
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The user is asking about the direction from which a box is entering the video. This question is purely visual and cannot be answered by the transcript alone.",
"Thought": "Since the question is about a visual event, I need to use the visual tools to find the answer. The first step would be to use the query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool to find the timestamps where a box is detected in the video.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"frames_query":"box"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "00:00:14, 00:00:01, 00:00:15"}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The tool has returned three timestamps where a box is detected in the video. These timestamps are 00:00:14, 00:00:01, and 00:00:15.",
"Thought": "I need to analyze these timestamps one by one using the query_GPT4_Vision tool to determine from which side the box is entering the video. I will start with the earliest timestamp, which is 00:00:01.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_GPT4_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"timestamp":"00:00:01",
"query":"These are the still frames from a short video clip. From which direction is the box entering the scene?"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "The box is coming from the right side of the screen."}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The tool has returned that the box is entering from the right side of the screen at the timestamp 00:00:01.",
"Thought": "This information directly answers the user's question. There is no need to analyze the other timestamps.",
"Answer": "The box is entering the video from the right side."
}
Critic Feedback:
{"Critic Feedback": {"Criteria 1": "The user's question has been fully answered. The agent identified the correct direction from which the box is entering the video as from the right side.", "Criteria 2": "The reasoning chain was efficient in determining the answer to the user's question. It used the appropriate visual tool to identify timestamps where the box appears and then analyzed the earliest timestamp to answer the question. Since the first timestamp provided the necessary information, there was no need to analyze the others.", "Criteria 3": "There are no hallucinations present in the reasoning chain. The query_GPT4_Vision's reported observation of the box entering from the right side is confirmed by the provided images."}}
