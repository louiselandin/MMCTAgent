User Input:
At the end of the video, what is kept inside the recipient container?
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The user is asking about the contents of a container at the end of the video. This information is likely to be found in the visuals, but it's possible that the transcript might also contain some hints or references to it.",
"Thought": "I should first get the transcript of the video to see if it contains any information about the contents of the container at the end of the video.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "get_transcript",
"tool_input": 
{
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": ""}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The transcript of the video is empty. This means that the video does not contain any spoken words or the audio is not clear enough to generate a transcript.",
"Thought": "Since the transcript is empty, I need to rely on the visuals to answer the user's question. I will use the query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool to find the frames that show the recipient container at the end of the video.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"frames_query": "recipient container"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "00:00:43, 00:02:04, 00:01:02"}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool has returned three timestamps where the recipient container is likely to be shown in the video. The timestamps are in the order of their relevance, with the first one being the most relevant.",
"Thought": "I will use the query_GPT4_Vision tool to analyze the frames at these timestamps. Since the user asked about the end of the video, I will start with the last timestamp (00:02:04) as it is likely to be closer to the end of the video.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_GPT4_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"timestamp": "00:02:04",
"query": "These are the still frames from a short video clip. What is kept inside the recipient container?"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "The recipient container, which appears to be a clear glass, contains a red-orange liquid that could possibly be tomato juice or a similar vegetable/fruit juice. The context given suggests a demonstration or experiment, but based on the provided frames alone, the liquid remains consistent throughout, appearing to be a non-viscous, uniform liquid typical of common juices."}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "According to the analysis of the frames at the timestamp 00:02:04, the recipient container, which appears to be a clear glass, contains a red-orange liquid that could possibly be tomato juice or a similar vegetable/fruit juice.",
"Thought": "The information obtained from the frames at the timestamp 00:02:04 seems to answer the user's question. The recipient container at the end of the video contains a red-orange liquid, possibly a type of juice.",
"Answer": "At the end of the video, the recipient container, which appears to be a clear glass, contains a red-orange liquid. This could possibly be tomato juice or a similar vegetable/fruit juice."
}
Critic Feedback:
{"Critic Feedback": {"Criteria 1": "The user query about what is kept inside the recipient container at the end of the video is fully answered. The reasoning agent described the contents as a red-orange liquid, likely to be tomato juice or a similar juice, which is confirmed by the visuals in the images provided.", "Criteria 2": "The reasoning chain is comprehensive. The agent attempted to get a transcript, which could have contained information relevant to the query had it not been empty. When the transcript proved empty, the agent proceeded appropriately to use visual analysis tools to answer the user's question.", "Criteria 3": "There are no hallucinations present in the reasoning chain. The query_GPT4_Vision call accurately described the visuals shown in the images provided, confirming that the answer returned by the agent matched the evidence observed in the frames at timestamp 00:02:04."}}
