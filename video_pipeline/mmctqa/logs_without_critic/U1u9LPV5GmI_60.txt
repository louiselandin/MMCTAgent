Tell me the total number of exercise that the man does, excluding warming up
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The user wants to know the total number of exercises performed by a man in the video, excluding any warm-up activities. This information is likely to be found in the video's transcript, as it would typically mention the different exercises being performed.",
"Thought": "The first step should be to retrieve the video's transcript using the get_transcript tool. This will allow me to search for mentions of different exercises. If the transcript does not provide a clear answer, I may need to use the query_transcript tool to search for specific exercise-related phrases, or the query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool to visually identify different exercises.",
