User Input:
What is the sequence of things the person added in the mixer?
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The user is asking about the sequence of items that a person added to a mixer. This question requires understanding of both the video's transcript and visuals.",
"Thought": "I should first get the transcript of the video to see if it mentions the sequence of items added to the mixer. If the transcript does not provide a complete answer, I will need to analyze the video frames.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "get_transcript",
"tool_input": {}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000\nHello, now we are going to make a cocktail of blueberries and margarine.\n\n2\n00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000\nFor this we need a glass of tequila,\n\n3\n00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000\nquantrum, lime juice and 5-6 blueberries.\n\n4\n00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000\nPour the quantrum into the glass.\n\n5\n00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000\nAdd the lime juice.\n\n6\n00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:58,000\nAdd the quantrum.\n\n7\n00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:10,000\nAdd the margarine.\n\n8\n00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:25,000\nAdd the quantrum.\n\n9\n00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:45,000\nAdd the quantrum.\n\n10\n00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000\nThe blueberry margarine cocktail is ready.\n\n\n\n"}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The transcript mentions the sequence of items added to the mixer. However, there seems to be a repetition in the steps where 'quantrum' is mentioned multiple times. This could be a transcription error or a mistake in the video itself.",
"Thought": "I should verify the sequence of items added to the mixer by querying the video frames. I will start by querying the frames for the first item mentioned in the transcript, which is 'quantrum'.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision",

{
"frames_query": "quantrum"

Tool Output:
{"Output": "00:00:00, 00:00:04, 00:01:51"}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The tool returned three timestamps where 'quantrum' was detected in the video frames. The first timestamp is at the very start of the video, which might be when the ingredients were introduced. The second timestamp is early in the video, which could be when 'quantrum' was first added. The third timestamp is near the end of the video, which might be when 'quantrum' was added again, as mentioned in the transcript.",
"Thought": "I should use the query_GPT4_Vision tool to verify what is happening in the video at these timestamps. I will start with the first timestamp.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_GPT4_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"timestamp": "00:00:00",
"query": "These are the still frames from a short video clip. Can you describe what is happening, specifically regarding any items being added to a mixer?"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "I'm sorry, but it appears there is an issue with the images you've provided as they are heavily distorted and the textual details are garbled. This distortion makes it impossible to accurately describe what is happening in the frames, specifically regarding any items being added to a mixer. If you have clearer images or additional context, please provide them so I can assist you appropriately."}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The tool was unable to provide information about the first timestamp due to distortion in the images. This could be due to the video quality or some other issue.",
"Thought": "I should try the next timestamp to see if the tool can provide more information about the sequence of items added to the mixer.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_GPT4_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"timestamp": "00:00:04",
"query": "These are the still frames from a short video clip. Can you describe what is happening, specifically regarding any items being added to a mixer?"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "I'm sorry, but it appears that the images provided are not displaying the content as described. The frames do not show any items being added to a mixer or any related activity. The initial frames are heavily distorted, followed by what seems to be a title or a logo screen saying \"Cbar PROJECT.\" The remaining frames show an individual standing by a bar, with text indicating the preparation of a \"Strawberry Margarita\" by a person named Stanislav Ostashkov. Due to the image distortions and the focus on the person rather than the process of making the drink, I cannot provide a detailed description of any items being added to a mixer."}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The tool was unable to provide information about the second timestamp as well. The frames do not show any items being added to a mixer. Instead, they show a title or logo screen and an individual standing by a bar.",
"Thought": "I should try the last timestamp to see if the tool can provide more information about the sequence of items added to the mixer. If this does not work, I may need to try a different approach.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_GPT4_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"timestamp": "00:01:51",
"query": "These are the still frames from a short video clip. Can you describe what is happening, specifically regarding any items being added to a mixer?"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "Based on the repeated frame provided, it appears that instructions for making a Strawberry Margarita are being showcased. The frames do not capture the actual process of ingredients being added to a blender but instead display a recipe card detailing the ingredients and amounts needed for the cocktail. The ingredients listed are:\n\n- Tequila: 50 ml\n- Cointreau: 30 ml\n- Lime juice: 25 ml\n- Strawberries: 50 grams\n\nThe method is mentioned as 'blender' indicating that these ingredients are intended to be combined and mixed using a blender. The final product is to be served in a 'Margarita' glass. The frame also contains an image of the finished Strawberry Margarita garnished with a lime slice on the rim of the glass."}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The tool provided information about the last timestamp. However, the frames do not show the actual process of items being added to a mixer. Instead, they display a recipe card for a Strawberry Margarita, which is different from the Blueberry Margarita mentioned in the transcript. This discrepancy could be due to an error in the transcript or the video.",
"Thought": "Given the discrepancies between the transcript and the video frames, it is difficult to determine the exact sequence of items added to the mixer. However, based on the information available, I can provide a tentative answer.",
"Answer": "According to the transcript, the sequence of items added to the mixer is as follows: quantrum, lime juice, quantrum, margarine, and quantrum. However, the video frames do not show the actual process of these items being added to a mixer. Instead, they display a recipe card for a Strawberry Margarita, which includes tequila, cointreau, lime juice, and strawberries. Please note that there may be discrepancies between the transcript and the video frames, and the actual sequence of items added to the mixer may be different."
