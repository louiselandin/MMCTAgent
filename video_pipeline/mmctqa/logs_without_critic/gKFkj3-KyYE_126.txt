When did the character on the left side of the table got up to leave?
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The user is asking about a specific event in the video where a character, who is on the left side of the table, gets up to leave. This question requires both visual and temporal information from the video.",
"Thought": "The first step is to get the transcript of the video to see if there is any mention of the character leaving or any related event. If the transcript does not provide the necessary information, we will need to use the visual tools to find the answer.",

We are now no longer companions, boon or otherwise.\n\n59\n00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000\nWe are now merely acquaintances.\n\n60\n00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000\nTo amend the words of Toy Story, you have not got a friend in me.\n\n61\n00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000\nI'm going to go home and take a nap.\n\n62\n00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000\nWell, tell it to someone who cares.\n\n\n\n"}

{"Output": "The character on the left side of the table is a man wearing a green long-sleeved shirt and seated throughout the sequence of the frames. His actions over the course of the still frames progress as follows:\n\n1. In the first few frames, he is seen with his left arm extended across the table as if reaching for something or making a point in a conversation.\n\n2. As the frames continue, he brings his left hand back toward himself, close to the table surface. At the same time, his right hand, which had been below the table or out of view, comes up to the table level holding what appears to be a yellow object, possibly a napkin or a piece of paper.\n\n3. Subsequently, he appears engaged in an activity on the table with his hands, possibly unfolding the yellow object or dealing with another item on the table that is not well-visible due to the angle and movements.\n\n4. His posture remains relatively consistent \u2013 he leans forward slightly, showing engagement and attention towards whatever is occurring at the table between him and the characters whose faces are obscured.\n\n5. Throughout all the frames, his facial expressions are not visible due to the angle and distance from the camera.\n\nThe actions suggest a casual, possibly conversational setting around a meal, typical of a lunchroom or cafeteria scene. The character's gestures and behavior indicate that he is actively engaged with his table companions."}

{"Output": "The character on the left side of the table appears to be engaged in a series of actions throughout these frames:\n\n1. In the first frame, the character is standing with the majority of his body oriented towards the right, looking towards the other character or direction outside the scene.\n\n2. In the second frame, they've moved slightly, indicating a conversation or interaction with the person across the table, as they begin to turn more towards their left.\n\n3. The third and fourth frames are very similar to the second, suggesting a continued interaction without significant movement.\n\n4. In the fifth frame, the character has turned significantly to his left, with his body largely oriented away from the table, indicating a shift of attention towards someone or something out of frame.\n\n5. The sixth frame continues this leftward turn and further attention away from the table.\n\n6. In the seventh and eighth frames, this character has fully turned their back to the camera, suggesting they may be preparing to leave or are currently leaving the table.\n\n7. The last two frames, there is no longer a left-side character visible at the table, confirming that the character has left the scene.\n\nThe character's gradual turn and final departure from the table suggest a transition in the scene's focus, possibly ending a conversation or interaction at the table."}
