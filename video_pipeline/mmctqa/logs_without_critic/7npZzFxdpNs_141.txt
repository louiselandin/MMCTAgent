{
"Observation": "The user is asking about the different joyous activities people participate in during the festival of colours, which is also known as Holi. This question requires understanding of the video content, both from the transcript and the visuals, as the activities can be described in the transcript and also shown in the visuals.",

"Thought": "Since the transcript is empty, the information about the joyous activities during the festival of colours can only be obtained from the visuals of the video. Therefore, I need to use the query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool to retrieve timestamps of frames that might contain relevant visuals. The search query for this tool will be based on the user's question.",
