    "## Example Notebook: Using VideoAgent\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ Setup Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensure you have created an `.env` file in the **same directory** as this notebook. It must contain all required environment variables (e.g., API keys or configuration values expected by `VideoAgent`).\n",
    "- Make sure all required libraries are installed by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### About\n",
    "\n",
    "**VideoAgent** operates in two key stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Video Retrieval** – Given a user query, the agent retrieves relevant videos from a pre-ingested **Azure AI Search index**. This search ensures that only contextually relevant videos are passed on for deep analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Video Question Answering (QA)** – After retrieval, the agent uses the **Multi-Modal Critical Thinking (MMCT)** framework ([arxiv.org/abs/2405.18358](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18358)) to generate a high-quality answer. MMCT involves two agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Planner**: Drives the reasoning process using a structured toolchain, generating an initial response.\n",
    "   - **Critic (optional)**: Analyzes the planner’s output and, if needed, provides feedback that prompts an improved final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** The critic agent is enabled by default. You can disable it by setting `use_critic_agent=False` during initialization.  \n",
    "> **Disabling the critic agent skips the feedback loop and may reduce the accuracy of the final response.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike independent tool selection, **VideoAgent uses a fixed pipeline** of tools that work collaboratively during the QA stage. These tools are automatically orchestrated by the planner:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `GET_SUMMARY_TRANSCRIPT` – Extracts the full transcript and a high-level visual summary of the video.\n",
    "- `QUERY_SUMMARY_TRANSCRIPT` – Given a query, this tool identifies **three timestamps** in the transcript that are most relevant.\n",
    "- `QUERY_AZURE_COMPUTER_VISION` _(optional)_ – Uses **Azure Computer Vision** to return **three additional timestamps** related to the visual content of the query.\n",
    "- `QUERY_GPT4V` – Uses **OpenAI's GPT-4V** to inspect video frames around the identified timestamps and generate a detailed response grounded in both visual and textual understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, all tools are used in a coordinated pipeline. You can disable **only** the Azure Computer Vision tool by setting `use_azure_cv_tool=False` during agent initialization.\n"
