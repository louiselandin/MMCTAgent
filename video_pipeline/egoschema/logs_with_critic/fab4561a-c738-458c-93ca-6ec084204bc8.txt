I can use the query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool to search for these stages.

Tool Output:
{"Output": "The activity depicted in these frames shows a person engaged in some form of ground or earthwork. The individual is in the process of digging or chiseling at the ground with a pickaxe. The frames show a close-up, point-of-view perspective, likely from a head-mounted camera, given the consistency of the viewpoint which includes the person's feet and the tools they are using.\n\nHere is a step-by-step description based on the frames provided:\n\n1. The first frame shows the pickaxe just touching the ground, ready to start digging.\n2. In the next few frames, we see the pickaxe being swung and impacting the soil, indicating the breaking up of the hard-packed earth or clay. The person seems to be trying to create a trench or perhaps is looking to uproot something from the ground. It's evident that the ground is somewhat compact, as shown by the amount of effort required to break it up.\n3. As the sequence continues, the person repeatedly strikes the same area, which indicates a focused effort, perhaps to reach a certain depth or to break a particularly hard piece of substrate.\n4. Some of the later frames show the pickaxe being dragged back, possibly to clear loosened dirt or to prepare for another forceful dig into the ground.\n\nThroughout the frames, it's clear that one hand is gloved while the other is not, suggesting the person put on a glove to protect one hand predominantly or perhaps lost one of the pair during work. Construction materials like blocks and a black bucket are scattered around the area, and a metal rim of some sort is partially buried in the ground, which may imply some form of landscaping or construction work. The absence of greenery suggests the location is not being prepared for planting but perhaps for a foundation or some kind of hardscaping."}

Critic Feedback:
{"Critic Feedback": {"Criteria 1": "The agent conducted a comprehensive analysis of the video with the use of tools to extract and verify information from specific timestamps. This thorough approach is consistent with the objective of identifying critical construction stages. However, while the agent concluded with 'digging the foundation', there is no tangible evidence regarding 'laying the bricks' from either the images or the tool outputs. The agent could enhance accuracy by providing a verification of the 'laying the bricks' stage if portrayed in the video.", "Criteria 2": "There are no hallucinations observed in the application of the tools and the extraction of information. The descriptions provided by the query_GPT4_Vision tool correctly reflect the activities depicted within the images. The reasoning chain outputs are based on the visual data provided by the images, aligning with the activities described. However, the decision to select Option 4 may be partially based on incomplete information, as there is no reference to 'laying the bricks' among the provided evidence."}}

{"Output": "The sequence of images depicts a person engaged in what appears to be some sort of ground or garden work. Here is the detailed activity breakdown:\n\n1. In the first image, we see the person holding a tool (looks like a hoe or mattock) working on a narrow patch of ground. A piece of fabric or tarp is pulled to the side, revealing the soil underneath. There\u2019s debris scattered around the area, such as small pieces of trash and some building materials like concrete blocks.\n\n2. The second and third images are quite similar, showing the person using the tool to dig or hoe the soil. The motion is consistent with breaking up the ground or clearing a space, possibly for planting or creating a trench or path.\n\n3. The fourth image shows the person has stopped working and is assessing the area, perhaps considering the next steps in the task.\n\n4. In the fifth image, the person resumes work. The tool is used to interact with a cement block, perhaps attempting to position or dig around it.\n\n5. The sixth image is a continuation of interactions with the cement blocks, showing some manual adjustment by the person's hand.\n\n6. Images seven and eight demonstrate a repetitive process similar to the initial pictures, suggesting a continuous ground cultivation or clearing activity.\n\n7. The ninth image has a slight change, showing a larger section of exposed soil, indicating the progression of the work being done.\n\n8. The last image returns to the activity shown in the beginning, as the person continues to work the ground with the tool, indicating an ongoing process.\n\nThroughout the series, it is not exactly clear what the final objective is, but the overall activity involves soil cultivation or modification, potentially as a part of a landscaping or ground preparation task."}

{"Output": "The sequence of still frames you've provided captures a first-person perspective of an outdoor activity, likely related to gardening or landscaping. It appears to be part of a project for creating or repairing a garden bed.\n\n1. The first frame shows a gloved hand reaching down towards a dug trench with loose soil and debris.\n2. The second frame, like the first, features the gloved hand near the soil but zoomed out slightly, showing the length of the trench running parallel to a garden bed that is retained by bricks or stones.\n3. The third frame is similar to the second, with the hand closer to the soil, suggesting some work is being done within the trench possibly spreading or smoothing the soil.\n4. In the fourth frame, we see both hands, suggesting that the person may be clearing the trench or preparing it for further work.\n5. The fifth frame has one hand down in the trench while the other is out of view, maintaining the focus on working within or alongside the trench.\n6. The sixth frame shows both hands within the trench once again, emphasizing consistent work or activity within this area.\n7. The seventh frame contains another individual's legs, indicating that there might be multiple people involved in this task. The focus remains on the trench and working with the soil.\n8. In the eighth frame, the perspective is similar to the previous frames with the additional presence of the person wearing black footwear by the trench, suggesting collaboration.\n9. The ninth frame is similar to the seventh and eighth, with further evidence of multiple individuals working together.\n10. The final frame offers a view with tools in the foreground, such as a leaf blower and a bucket, which indicates that yard work of some sort is indeed taking place.\n\nThroughout the frames, the consistent elements are the trench, the garden bed, the tools for yard work, and the presence of more than one person, pointing to an ongoing yard maintenance or landscaping project. The actions are repetitive, involving interaction with the soil in the trench, likely part of a process in preparing the ground for planting or for installing some kind of landscape feature."}
