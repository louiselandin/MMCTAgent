Here is a sequential breakdown of the action:\n\n1. The first image shows a top-down view with a grindstone visible on the left and a person's hands holding a white cloth, with grains scattered on the ground.\n\n2. The person uses their left hand to hold the cloth, possibly to gather or catch the milled flour, while the right hand grabs a handful of grains from a pile within a metallic bowl.\n\n3-4. The individual systematically scoops the grains with the right hand.\n\n5. They transfer the grains to a cup-like part of the grindstone apparatus.\n\n6-10. The person rotates the handheld tool attached to the grindstone in a circular motion, which in turn grinds the grain inserted from above. \n\nThroughout these frames, the motion is continuous, indicating a repeated process: scoop the grain, place it into the mill hopper, and rotate the top part of the mill to grind the grain. This traditional method of grinding produces flour and could be part of a food preparation process or grain processing activity."}
