Tool Output:
{"Output": "The sequence of still frames depicts an individual positioned on a leg extension machine commonly found in gym settings, engaging in what appears to be a leg extension exercise. The frames show a progressive movement where the individual's legs move from a bent position to a more extended position against the resistance provided by the machine. This exercise is designed to target the quadriceps muscles at the front of the thigh. Throughout the frames, one can see the angle at the knee joint increases as the individual extends their legs, which is indicative of performing a leg extension exercise."}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The tool has confirmed that the frames at the timestamp 00:00:54 show a person starting a leg extension exercise. The frames depict the person's legs moving from a bent position to a more extended position, which is characteristic of a leg extension exercise.",
"Thought": "Now that I have confirmed the start of the leg extension exercise in the video, I can provide the user with the answer.",
"Answer": "The leg extension exercise starts at the timestamp 00:00:54 in the video."
