User Input:
Neymar points his finger towards which direction, while celebrating a goal he scored?
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The user is asking about a specific moment in the video where Neymar is celebrating a goal. The question is about the direction Neymar is pointing his finger towards during his celebration. This information is not directly available in the transcript and requires visual analysis.",
"Thought": "Since the question is about a specific visual detail, I need to retrieve the relevant frames from the video. I will use the query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool with a query related to Neymar's goal celebration.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"frames_query":"Neymar celebrating a goal"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "00:00:04, 00:00:34, 00:00:53"}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The tool has returned three timestamps: 00:00:04, 00:00:34, and 00:00:53. These are the moments in the video where Neymar's goal celebration, which matches the query, is likely to be found.",
"Thought": "I will now use the query_GPT4_Vision tool to analyze the visuals at these timestamps. I will start with the first timestamp, 00:00:04, and ask the tool about the direction Neymar is pointing his finger towards.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_GPT4_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"timestamp":"00:00:04",
"query":"These are the still frames from a short video clip. Can you tell me the direction Neymar is pointing his finger towards while celebrating a goal?"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "Based on the sequence of images, Neymar appears to be pointing and celebrating towards the crowd or fans in the stands. His finger and gaze direction, as well as his body orientation in the images, suggest that he is interacting with the spectators off-pitch to share the excitement of his goal."}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "According to the output from the query_GPT4_Vision tool, Neymar is pointing his finger towards the crowd or fans in the stands while celebrating his goal at the timestamp 00:00:04.",
"Thought": "The output from the tool seems to answer the user's question. Neymar is pointing towards the crowd or fans in the stands. There is no need to check the other timestamps as the question has been answered.",
"Answer": "Neymar is pointing his finger towards the crowd or fans in the stands while celebrating his goal."

Neymar's finger-pointing direction during the celebration was identified as being towards the crowd or fans in the stands.", "Criteria 2": "The reasoning chain was comprehensive. The agent used the query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision to find relevant video frames which might contain the celebration of Neymar and then successfully analyzed the image from the first provided timestamp with query_GPT4_Vision to answer the question.", "Criteria 3": "There are no hallucinations in the reasoning chain. The analysis of the frames for the timestamp 00:00:04 matches the gesture of Neymar in the provided images. The agent answered based on the analysis of the images and not on general knowledge."}}
