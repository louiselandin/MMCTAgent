GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The transcript mentions 'shuffling' multiple times. This could be a reference to a dance move, specifically the 'Shuffle' dance.",
"Thought": "Given the context and the repetition of the phrase 'every day I'm shuffling', it's likely that the dance move being talked about is the 'Shuffle' dance. However, to confirm this, I should search the video frames for visual confirmation of the dance move.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"frames_query": "Shuffle dance"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "00:02:14, 00:02:58, 00:01:53"}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The tool has returned three timestamps where the 'Shuffle' dance move might be visually present in the video.",
"Thought": "I should now use the query_GPT4_Vision tool to verify the dance move at these timestamps. I will start with the first timestamp.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_GPT4_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"timestamp": "00:02:14",
"query": "These are the still frames from a short video clip. Can you describe the dance move being performed?"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "The dance move being performed in the sequence of still frames appears to be a lively group dance with a focus on foot shuffling combined with arm movements. It seems to be a coordinated group activity where the dancers are repeatedly shuffling their feet in a swift and rhythmic fashion while simultaneously moving their arms, possibly in response to the beats of the music. The energy of the move is high, and it is likely designed to be a fun, communal dance that is possibly part of a larger choreographed routine."}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The output from the GPT4 Vision tool confirms that the dance move being performed in the video at the timestamp 00:02:14 is a lively group dance with a focus on foot shuffling and arm movements. This aligns with the description of the 'Shuffle' dance move.",
"Thought": "Given the information from the transcript and the confirmation from the GPT4 Vision tool, I am confident that the dance move being talked about in the video is the 'Shuffle' dance move.",
"Answer": "The dance move being talked about in the video is the 'Shuffle' dance move."
