A sudden emission of green gas or vapor fills the air around the character, seemingly originating from the character themselves.\n4. The character quickly uses their hands in an attempt to disperse or deflect the green gas.\n5. Eventually, the green gas dissipates, and the character appears to be examining their hands before abruptly turning as if to leave or react to something off-screen.\n\nUnfortunately, without audio or text panels, it's impossible to determine exactly what the character says afterward. However, judging by the sequence of events and the character's body language, it is clear that the situation was unexpected and possibly distressing for the character."}
