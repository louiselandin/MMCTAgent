{"Output": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600\nNow, we saw a ton of deer that afternoon and early the next morning and actually got a\n\n2\n00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,960\ncouple opportunities to get close, but Pete really never found another deer he got excited\n\n3\n00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,719\nabout until about 10 o'clock on the second morning and we came up on a cliff, almost\n\n4\n00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:23,040\na canyon looking situation with scrub brush down below us and Pete found Whopper Daddy\n\n5\n00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,360\nbedded under a bush.\n\n6\n00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,520\nIt was the buck of my dreams.\n\n7\n00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,959\nHe was a 4x4 with brow tines and he had velvet.\n\n8\n00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:34,040\nI told Pete, I said, Pete, if I've got my choice, I want one that's got velvet and he\n\n9\n00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,040\nfound it for me.\n\n10\n00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:43,200\nNow, it was just a matter of getting in on him.\n\n11\n00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,880\nOne of the things I'd like to clarify is the fact that in the West, they judge antlers\n\n12\n00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,680\na little different than we do.\n\n13\n00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,880\nYou'll hear them say a 4x4 or a 3x3 and basically, they're counting points on each side.\n\n14\n00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,000\nA 4x4 would be an eastern 8 point.\n\n15\n00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,240\nSo, when you're judging those animals and you hear them say a 4x4, to you and I, that's\n\n16\n00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,239\nan 8 pointer.\n\n17\n00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,199\nNow, I had read a little bit about stalking mule deer and I'd actually seen a couple of\n\n18\n00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:14,720\ntelevision shows where guys had used a bow and gotten really close to a mule deer and\n\n19\n00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,199\nthey all take off their boots and put on a heavy pair of socks and stalk that way and\n\n20\n00:01:20,199 --> 00:01:24,000\nI kind of thought it was a joke and that was the first thing that Pete told me when we\n\n21\n00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,879\nstarted stalking on this mule deer was that we're going to take our boots off, put on\n\n22\n00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,160\na heavy pair of socks and it'll really reduce our noise.\n\n23\n00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,160\nWell, the bad news is, is this is like desert country and you've got cactus and you've got\n\n24\n00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,879\nthistles and you've got yucca plants.\n\n25\n00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:44,199\nEverything that can stick or cut you is in the ground and the whole time you're walking,\n\n26\n00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:45,199\nyou're feeling it.\n\n27\n00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:51,000\nSo, it does cut down the noise, but boy, oh boy, is it hard on your feet.\n\n28\n00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,879\nAs soon as Pete saw this big buck behind the bush underneath, he motioned for me to crawl\n\n29\n00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:00,040\nup so I eased up to the edge of the rim rock and I pulled my glasses up and I looked over\n\n30\n00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,639\nand I was pretty excited.\n\n31\n00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:04,040\nI mean, that was the deer that I really wanted.\n\n32\n00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,199\nNow, the problem was how to get to him and we felt like it was best to actually back\n\n33\n00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,800\noff the cliff and circle way downwind and try to come in at the exact same level of\n\n34\n00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,839\nthe deer because we had a steep, steep bank, a steep canyon wall and then a flat bottom.\n\n35\n00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:24,320\nWe felt like with the deer positioned behind that bush, we could use that bush as cover\n\n36\n00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,919\nand come in right from behind him.\n\n37\n00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,559\nThe wind was right.\n\n38\n00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:30,080\nEverything seemed like it was going to be perfect to kill that deer.\n\n39\n00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,839\nNow, this was one of those stalks that seemed like it took four days.\n\n40\n00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:39,720\nWe came all the way down and around, probably two or three hundred yards and then got down\n\n41\n00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,240\non the flat and there wasn't a lot of cover so we were just picking and choosing our way\n\n42\n00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:50,000\nfrom bush to bush and basically, I'm trying to blend in behind Pete and I'm trying to\n\n43\n00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,240\nfollow his body language and his cues.\n\n44\n00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,199\nWhen he hesitates, I need to stop.\n\n45\n00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:58,320\nWhen he kneels down, I kneel down and that's exactly what you have to do when you're with\n\n46\n00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,479\na guide like that.\n\n47\n00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:03,600\nYou have to let him cue you in on every movement you need to make.\n\n48\n00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:10,559\nThe closer we got to the deer, it was becoming really obvious that that bush that was shielding\n\n49\n00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:15,440\nhim from us, it kept him from being able to see us, but it made it extremely hard for\n\n50\n00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,160\nus to see him and more importantly, get a shot.\n\n51\n00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,199\nSo we kept quartering left and right trying to jockey for position to where we could find\n\n52\n00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:29,119\none little lane that might give me an opportunity so when he stood up to adjust or to eat a\n\n53\n00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:31,639\nlittle bit, that I could slide an arrow in there.\n\n54\n00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:37,800\nAnd we're inside of 40 yards this whole time and then 30 and then 25 and now I've got nowhere\n\n55\n00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800\nelse to go.\n\n56\n00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,600\nI can't bridge that gap any further and I've still got a screen of bushes in front of me.\n\n57\n00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,039\nI was at one of those positions where I just really didn't know what to do.\n\n58\n00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:53,639\nPete actually sent me in that last 5 or 10 yards to get me inside a bow range and I kept\n\n59\n00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:58,880\nlooking back, really like a big brother, man I need some direction, what do I do?\n\n60\n00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,960\nAnd he and I both kind of saw the opportunity at the same time.\n\n61\n00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,279\nThere was like one little lane that fed right up to where the deer was bedded.\n\n62\n00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:11,440\nHe was actually pawed in and dug down into the dirt and Pete and I decided that we were\n\n63\n00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,679\ngoing to kind of get together and slide up into that lane and then set up a shooting\n\n64\n00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:17,720\nposition to where we could take the shot.\n\n65\n00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:23,880\nThe bad news is that when we made that move, there must have just been enough open between\n\n66\n00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:31,279\nthe deer's eye and us to give him that visual on us and man, he was gone and I mean gone.\n\n67\n00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,040\nWhen they see you or when they smell you, there's no hesitation.\n\n68\n00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,959\nThey are out of dodge.\n\n69\n00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:44,239\nOne of the things that I had the most difficulty getting used to being from the east was the\n\n70\n00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:47,119\namount of glassing that goes into hunting a mule deer.\n\n71\n00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:51,880\nYou're constantly with your spotting scope or with your binoculars looking for deer.\n\n72\n00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,440\nBack home, if you can see a deer 75 to 100 yards away, that's a long ways.\n\n73\n00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,119\nYou rarely ever use binoculars.\n\n74\n00:04:58,119 --> 00:05:03,119\nThese guys live with them on their chest and it's so important to have good optics and\n\n75\n00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:07,760\nbe able to see those deer a long ways away and pick your opportunities.\n\n76\n00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:14,600\nWe continued to see so many mule deer and actually had stalks every day on beautiful,\n\n77\n00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,480\nbeautiful bucks in decent spots, but there's so many variables to archery hunting.\n\n78\n00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,720\nWith gun hunting, you can sit back there at 100, 150 yards, get in position and make the\n\n79\n00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,880\nshot, but with bow hunting, everything's got to be right.\n\n80\n00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,880\nYou've got to be inside of 40 yards and you've got to have a clean area to the vitals and\n\n81\n00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,119\nI would get into situations where they would see me moving or maybe where the wind would\n\n82\n00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:44,119\nget me and I was in situations where one time, I was on a canyon cliff above a big mule deer\n\n83\n00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:50,440\nand I got so close to the deer that I could peek over and I could see the tips of his\n\n84\n00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,320\nfeet and I could hear him belching.\n\n85\n00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,040\nI was four yards from that deer and I still could not get an arrow into it.\n\n86\n00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,200\nTried to wait him out and eventually, that little freaky gust of wind came and boom,\n\n87\n00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,320\nhe was out of there.\n\n88\n00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,399\nYou might kind of think that was funny watching me run across the ridge in my little white\n\n89\n00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:12,200\nsocks trying to get a shot at that deer as he goes down the backside, but by that time,\n\n90\n00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,480\nI was pretty darn frustrated.\n\n\n\n"}

Tool Output:
{"Output": "The provided still frames seem to capture a moment in the wilderness, likely during a hunting trip, where a deer is spotted by the individual recording the video. The frames predominantly show close-up, out-of-focus shots, possibly indicating rapid, unplanned movement, or a quick turn of the head towards the direction of the deer.\n\nThe last three frames give a clearer picture. They show a natural landscape with grassland and shrubs, and in these frames, a deer is visible. It appears the deer is in motion, possibly running or quickly moving away through the terrain. The deer seems alert and aware of its surroundings, which is a common behavior when they sense potential threats or disturbances in their environment.\n\nThe sequence of the frames suggests the deer may have been startled or disturbed, prompting it to move quickly through the grassland, while the person holding the camera seems to be tracking its movement. There is no direct indication of any aggressive action towards the deer in these frames, only images that suggest observation and perhaps the pursuit of wildlife, which is typical in a hunting scenario."}

Critic Feedback:
{"Critic Feedback": {"Criteria 1": "The question 'When did the deer run away from the hunters?' was partially answered. The agent identified the correct segment of the transcript where the event was described but failed to provide visual confirmation of the event. The images shown do not depict a deer running away but rather a person. To enhance the answer, the agent should have provided images that explicitly capture the deer in the act of running away.", "Criteria 2": "The agent performed a comprehensive analysis by using both the transcript and visual verification. However, the agent should have used additional images that actually show the deer running away to confirm the event visually. If the provided images are not sufficient, the agent should review adjacent timestamps to find the appropriate visual evidence.", "Criteria 3": "There is a hallucination present in the output from the query_GPT4_Vision tool. The images provided only feature a person speaking, but the description from the output mentions a deer running away, which is not visually substantiated by the given images."}}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The critic feedback suggests that the visual confirmation of the deer running away was not adequately provided. The images from the timestamp 00:04:27 do not explicitly show the deer running away, and there is a discrepancy between the visual evidence and the output from the query_GPT4_Vision tool. The critic also points out that the images only feature a person speaking, which is not consistent with the description of a deer running away.",
"Thought": "Given the critic's feedback, it seems necessary to further investigate the visuals around the timestamp 00:04:27.

Tool Output:
{"Output": "The first three still frames show close-up shots of a hunter. He appears focused and alert, suggesting that he is likely watching the deer and possibly waiting for the right moment to take a shot or observe the animal. The hunter's facial expressions hint at concentration and readiness.\n\nThe fourth frame is blurry and indistinct, it's difficult to discern any action or detail from this image.\n\nStarting from the fifth frame, the action shifts to a deer in a natural environment. Frame by frame, it documents the following:\n\n- Frame 5: A blurred image, possibly the surroundings where the deer is.\n- Frame 6: The deer appears in the middle of a grassy field with bushes and shrubs, likely startled or observing the environment.\n- Frame 7: The deer is still standing in the field, possibly becoming aware of the presence of the hunters or any danger.\n- Frame 8: The deer starts to move, it seems to be taking off or beginning to run. This might be in response to detecting a threat.\n- Frame 9: The deer is seen in motion, likely running away to escape from perceived danger.\n- Frame 10: Another blurred image, suggesting rapid movement or transition in the scene, possibly as the deer continues to flee.\n\nThe series of images suggest a narrative where the hunter is watching the deer, and the deer becomes aware of the threat and decides to flee. The exact actions or outcomes cannot be determined from the still frames alone without more context."}
