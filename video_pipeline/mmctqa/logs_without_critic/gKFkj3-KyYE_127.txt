We are now no longer companions, boon or otherwise.\n\n59\n00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000\nWe are now merely acquaintances.\n\n60\n00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000\nTo amend the words of Toy Story, you have not got a friend in me.\n\n61\n00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000\nI'm going to go home and take a nap.\n\n62\n00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000\nWell, tell it to someone who cares.\n\n\n\n"}

In multiple frames, this individual's hands are visible near the coffee mug, suggesting they are either handling the mug directly or performing an action related to coffee preparation or consumption, such as adding sugar or stirring.\n\nIn the surrounding environment, there are other individuals, but their actions are not clearly associated with coffee, based on the available frames. The cafeteria setting suggests that coffee may be a common beverage choice among the characters present in the scene, although specific discussions or other explicit actions directly related to coffee beyond what the one individual is doing are not discernible from these stills."}
