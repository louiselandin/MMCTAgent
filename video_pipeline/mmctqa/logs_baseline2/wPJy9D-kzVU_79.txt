The given frames are for the 00:04:37,711 -> 00:04:46,419 timestamp range.
Here is the visual description of a video:

00:00:48,382 -> 00:00:57,090
In each of the frames provided, there appears to be an individual wearing a cap, a grey jacket, and what seems to be a green shirt underneath. The background suggests an outdoor setting, likely a wooded or park area due to the presence of trees and natural lighting.

The individual’s head is facing towards the left-hand side from the perspective of the viewer. It can be observed that their mouth is open in varying degrees across the frames, implying that they might be speaking or expressing something verbally. Given that the person's face is not visible, one can only speculate about their exact expressions or the context of the discussion; however, the open mouth does suggest active communication.

No significant movement or change in the person's attire or the background environment is detectable through the sequence of frames. This consistency suggests that the individual is in a steady position possibly engaging in a filmed conversation or interview, maintaining the same posture throughout the sequence of images. The setting remains consistent, reinforcing the likelihood that this is a single continuous take with the focus on the individual speaking.

00:04:37,711 -> 00:04:46,419
The ten frames from the short video clip provide glimpses of two primary subjects in distinct settings. The first series of frames depict an animal, specifically a deer, mid-motion in a natural, grassy environment. The animal appears to be in swift movement, either running or leaping through the grassland. The motion blur evident in the frames suggests rapid movement across the terrain.

The subsequent series of frames shift to a close-up of a person. Though the face is obscured, it is possible to discern that the individual is wearing a dark cap and has light-colored hair visible beneath it. The headgear and attire suggest an outdoor setting, potentially aligning with the natural environment where the deer was spotted. In each of these frames, the individual seems to be in a stationary position, with the focus on the side profile of the obscured face rather than any dynamic action. The verdant background, with blurred greenery, indicates that these frames likely continue within the same setting as the initial animal shots.

00:03:58,038 -> 00:04:06,747
The sequence of still frames depicts a natural outdoor setting, primarily focused on a dry grassy hillside with sporadic shrubbery and rock formations. Over the course of the frames, we observe two individuals at a distance, seemingly walking or hiking through this rugged terrain. The environment suggests a warm or arid climate, given the dryness of the vegetation and the clear skies. Additionally, the terrain appears to be somewhat steep, as indicated by the angle at which the individuals are seen walking. The final frame switches to a close-up view of the back of a person's head, wearing a cap, with no discernible background, which is a stark contrast to the previous frames of open landscape.

Here is the video transcript:

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Now, we saw a ton of deer that afternoon and early the next morning and actually got a

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,960
couple opportunities to get close, but Pete really never found another deer he got excited

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,719
about until about 10 o'clock on the second morning and we came up on a cliff, almost

4
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:23,040
a canyon looking situation with scrub brush down below us and Pete found Whopper Daddy

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,360
bedded under a bush.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,520
It was the buck of my dreams.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,959
He was a 4x4 with brow tines and he had velvet.

8
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:34,040
I told Pete, I said, Pete, if I've got my choice, I want one that's got velvet and he

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,040
found it for me.

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:43,200
Now, it was just a matter of getting in on him.

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,880
One of the things I'd like to clarify is the fact that in the West, they judge antlers

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,680
a little different than we do.

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,880
You'll hear them say a 4x4 or a 3x3 and basically, they're counting points on each side.

14
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,000
A 4x4 would be an eastern 8 point.

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,240
So, when you're judging those animals and you hear them say a 4x4, to you and I, that's

16
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,239
an 8 pointer.

17
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,199
Now, I had read a little bit about stalking mule deer and I'd actually seen a couple of

18
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:14,720
television shows where guys had used a bow and gotten really close to a mule deer and

19
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,199
they all take off their boots and put on a heavy pair of socks and stalk that way and

20
00:01:20,199 --> 00:01:24,000
I kind of thought it was a joke and that was the first thing that Pete told me when we

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,879
started stalking on this mule deer was that we're going to take our boots off, put on

22
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,160
a heavy pair of socks and it'll really reduce our noise.

23
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,160
Well, the bad news is, is this is like desert country and you've got cactus and you've got

24
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,879
thistles and you've got yucca plants.

25
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:44,199
Everything that can stick or cut you is in the ground and the whole time you're walking,

26
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:45,199
you're feeling it.

27
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:51,000
So, it does cut down the noise, but boy, oh boy, is it hard on your feet.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,879
As soon as Pete saw this big buck behind the bush underneath, he motioned for me to crawl

29
00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:00,040
up so I eased up to the edge of the rim rock and I pulled my glasses up and I looked over

30
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,639
and I was pretty excited.

31
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:04,040
I mean, that was the deer that I really wanted.

32
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,199
Now, the problem was how to get to him and we felt like it was best to actually back

33
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,800
off the cliff and circle way downwind and try to come in at the exact same level of

34
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,839
the deer because we had a steep, steep bank, a steep canyon wall and then a flat bottom.

35
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:24,320
We felt like with the deer positioned behind that bush, we could use that bush as cover

36
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,919
and come in right from behind him.

37
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,559
The wind was right.

38
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:30,080
Everything seemed like it was going to be perfect to kill that deer.

39
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,839
Now, this was one of those stalks that seemed like it took four days.

40
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:39,720
We came all the way down and around, probably two or three hundred yards and then got down

41
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,240
on the flat and there wasn't a lot of cover so we were just picking and choosing our way

42
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:50,000
from bush to bush and basically, I'm trying to blend in behind Pete and I'm trying to

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,240
follow his body language and his cues.

44
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,199
When he hesitates, I need to stop.

45
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:58,320
When he kneels down, I kneel down and that's exactly what you have to do when you're with

46
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,479
a guide like that.

47
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:03,600
You have to let him cue you in on every movement you need to make.

48
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:10,559
The closer we got to the deer, it was becoming really obvious that that bush that was shielding

49
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:15,440
him from us, it kept him from being able to see us, but it made it extremely hard for

50
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,160
us to see him and more importantly, get a shot.

51
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,199
So we kept quartering left and right trying to jockey for position to where we could find

52
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:29,119
one little lane that might give me an opportunity so when he stood up to adjust or to eat a

53
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:31,639
little bit, that I could slide an arrow in there.

54
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:37,800
And we're inside of 40 yards this whole time and then 30 and then 25 and now I've got nowhere

55
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
else to go.

56
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,600
I can't bridge that gap any further and I've still got a screen of bushes in front of me.

57
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,039
I was at one of those positions where I just really didn't know what to do.

58
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:53,639
Pete actually sent me in that last 5 or 10 yards to get me inside a bow range and I kept

59
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:58,880
looking back, really like a big brother, man I need some direction, what do I do?

60
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,960
And he and I both kind of saw the opportunity at the same time.

61
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,279
There was like one little lane that fed right up to where the deer was bedded.

62
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:11,440
He was actually pawed in and dug down into the dirt and Pete and I decided that we were

63
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,679
going to kind of get together and slide up into that lane and then set up a shooting

64
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:17,720
position to where we could take the shot.

65
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:23,880
The bad news is that when we made that move, there must have just been enough open between

66
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:31,279
the deer's eye and us to give him that visual on us and man, he was gone and I mean gone.

67
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,040
When they see you or when they smell you, there's no hesitation.

68
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,959
They are out of dodge.

69
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:44,239
One of the things that I had the most difficulty getting used to being from the east was the

70
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:47,119
amount of glassing that goes into hunting a mule deer.

71
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:51,880
You're constantly with your spotting scope or with your binoculars looking for deer.

72
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,440
Back home, if you can see a deer 75 to 100 yards away, that's a long ways.

73
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,119
You rarely ever use binoculars.

74
00:04:58,119 --> 00:05:03,119
These guys live with them on their chest and it's so important to have good optics and

75
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:07,760
be able to see those deer a long ways away and pick your opportunities.

76
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:14,600
We continued to see so many mule deer and actually had stalks every day on beautiful,

77
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,480
beautiful bucks in decent spots, but there's so many variables to archery hunting.

78
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,720
With gun hunting, you can sit back there at 100, 150 yards, get in position and make the

79
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,880
shot, but with bow hunting, everything's got to be right.

80
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,880
You've got to be inside of 40 yards and you've got to have a clean area to the vitals and

81
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,119
I would get into situations where they would see me moving or maybe where the wind would

82
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:44,119
get me and I was in situations where one time, I was on a canyon cliff above a big mule deer

83
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:50,440
and I got so close to the deer that I could peek over and I could see the tips of his

84
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,320
feet and I could hear him belching.

85
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,040
I was four yards from that deer and I still could not get an arrow into it.

86
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,200
Tried to wait him out and eventually, that little freaky gust of wind came and boom,

87
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,320
he was out of there.

88
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,399
You might kind of think that was funny watching me run across the ridge in my little white

89
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:12,200
socks trying to get a shot at that deer as he goes down the backside, but by that time,

90
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,480
I was pretty darn frustrated.

Here is a question on the video: When did the deer run away from the hunters?. Answer it based on the given information.



Answer:
The deer ran away from the hunters when they attempted to close the distance to get within shooting range. As they moved to set up a shooting position, enough visual space was created between the hunters and the deer's eyes, alerting the deer to their presence, which resulted in the deer running away quickly. This event is described in the transcript segments from 00:04:23,880 to 00:04:31,279, where it is mentioned, "The bad news is that when we made that move, there must have just been enough open between the deer's eye and us to give him that visual on us and man, he was gone and I mean gone. When they see you or when they smell you, there's no hesitation. They are out of dodge." The frames show a deer in motion, which likely corresponds to the moment it was startled and fled.
