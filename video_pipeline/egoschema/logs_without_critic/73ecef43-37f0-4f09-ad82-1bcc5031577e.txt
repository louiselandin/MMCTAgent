Option 0: The person in the video is trying to install a metal rod into a hole in a concrete staircase.
Option 1: The individual featured in the video is attempting to repair a damaged staircase that appears to be broken.
Option 2: The individual featured in the video is attempting to construct a brand new staircase design.
Option 3: In the video, the individual featured is attempting to thoroughly clean a heavily soiled staircase.
Option 4: The person in the video is trying to decorate a staircase.
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The question asks for the primary objective of the person in the video and how they accomplished it. The options suggest that the person could be doing something related to a staircase, such as installing a metal rod, repairing, constructing, cleaning, or decorating it.",
"Thought": "To answer this question, I need to first identify what the person is doing with the staircase. I can use the query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool to find frames where the person is interacting with the staircase. Based on the options, I can craft a search query like 'person with staircase'. Once I have the timestamps, I can use the query_GPT4_Vision tool to get a detailed description of what the person is doing in those frames.",
"Action":

"tool_name": "query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"frames_query":"person with staircase"
}

}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "00:02:51, 00:00:27, 00:00:21"}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The tool has returned three timestamps where the person is interacting with the staircase. The timestamps are '00:02:51', '00:00:27', and '00:00:21'.",
"Thought": "I will now use the query_GPT4_Vision tool to get a detailed description of what the person is doing in these frames. I will start with the first timestamp '00:02:51' as it is the highest match. I will craft a prompt asking the tool to describe the activity in these frames.",
"Action":

"tool_name": "query_GPT4_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"timestamp":"00:02:51",
"query":"These are the still frames from a short video clip. Describe the activity in these frames."
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "The sequence of still frames depicts a person engaged in a construction or renovation activity, specifically working on a set of stairs. Here is the breakdown of the actions captured:\n\n1. In the first few frames, the person is using a handheld power tool, likely a drill or a grinder, on the edge of a marble or tiled stair. The power tool is in motion, as indicated by the dust and particles being ejected from the work area.\n\n2. The view is from a first-person perspective, with the person's hands seen holding the power tool and working on the stair edge.\n\n3. A few of the images show a change in activity from using the power tool to inspecting or placing what appears to be a strip of material onto the edge of the stair where work was being done. This strip may be a protective or decorative edge profile, typically used to finish the stair tread aesthetically and prevent wear.\n\n4. The person continues to make adjustments to this edge strip, perhaps ensuring it's correctly positioned or secured onto the edge of the stair.\n\n5. The stair area appears dusty from the work, which indicates some sort of cutting, grinding, or preparation activity was or is ongoing. \n\n6. The person is wearing casual clothing, jeans, and flip-flops, which is noteworthy as typically more protective gear is expected in such work for safety.\n\nOverall, the activity revolves around improving or finishing the stair treads, likely as part of a larger construction or home improvement project."}

"Thought": "Based on the detailed description, it seems that the person is not installing a metal rod, repairing a damaged staircase, constructing a new staircase, or cleaning a staircase. They are working on improving or finishing the stair treads, which could be interpreted as decorating the staircase. Therefore, the answer is likely Option 4: The person in the video is trying to decorate a staircase.",
