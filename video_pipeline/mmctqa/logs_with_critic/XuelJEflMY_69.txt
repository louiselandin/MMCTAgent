User Input:
What is he writing on, when the video starts?
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The user wants to know what the person in the video is writing on at the start of the video. This question requires visual analysis.",
"Thought": "As per the guidelines, I should first get the transcript of the video to see if it provides any information about what the person is writing on at the start of the video.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "get_transcript",
"tool_input": {}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": ""}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The transcript of the video is empty, which means the video does not contain any spoken words or the audio is not clear enough to be transcribed.",
"Thought": "Since the transcript is empty, I need to analyze the visuals of the video to answer the user's question. I will use the query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool to find the moment when the person starts writing in the video.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"frames_query": "person writing"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "00:00:09, 00:03:04, 00:00:16"}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The tool has returned three timestamps where it detected a person writing. The first timestamp (00:00:09) is likely the start of the video where the person begins writing.",
"Thought": "I will use the query_GPT4_Vision tool to analyze the 10-second clip centered at the first timestamp (00:00:09) to determine what the person is writing on.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_GPT4_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"timestamp": "00:00:09",
"query": "These are the still frames from a short video clip. What is the person writing on?"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "The person is writing on a plain white piece of paper."}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "According to the output from the query_GPT4_Vision tool, the person is writing on a plain white piece of paper at the start of the video.",
"Thought": "This information directly answers the user's question.",
"Answer": "At the start of the video, the person is writing on a plain white piece of paper."
}
Critic Feedback:
{"Critic Feedback": {"Criteria 1": "The user query was fully answered. The visual analysis confirmed that the person is writing on a plain white piece of paper at the beginning of the video as requested by the user.", "Criteria 2": "The reasoning chain was thorough and properly escalated through the tools provided, from an initial transcript search, then moving on to frame-based visual search, and finally, detailed visual analysis to answer the query fully. No additional steps are necessary.", "Criteria 3": "There are no hallucinations present in the reasoning chain. The visual analysis matched the content of the provided images, indicating an accurate and truthful extraction of information."}}
