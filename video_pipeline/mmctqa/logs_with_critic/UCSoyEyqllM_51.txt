However, given the nature of the question, it is highly unlikely that the video will contain this specific statistic unless it is a video about Neymar's career.

In the images with the white kit featuring a red stripe, the team is Sevilla FC. The acronym 'SEV' on the scoreboard also corresponds to Sevilla FC.\n\n3. The team featured in the last image, where the scoreboard reads \"FCB 2 - 1 VIL,\" is Villarreal CF, as indicated by the abbreviation 'VIL' for the opposing team."}
