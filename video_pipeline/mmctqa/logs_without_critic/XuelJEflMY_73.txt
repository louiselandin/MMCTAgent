User Input:
How many spoons of colorant are required?
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The user is asking about the quantity of colorant required, which is likely to be mentioned in the video's transcript. This is a specific question that requires a direct answer.",
"Thought": "The first step is to retrieve the video's transcript to see if the answer to the user's question is mentioned there.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "get_transcript",
"tool_input": 
{
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": ""}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The transcript of the video is empty, which means there is no spoken content in the video. The answer to the user's question must be contained within the visuals of the video.",
"Thought": "Since the transcript is empty, the next step is to use the query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool to search the video's frames for visuals related to 'spoons of colorant'.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision",
"tool_input":

Tool Output:
{"Output": "00:00:50, 00:01:06, 00:01:00"}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool has returned three timestamps where visuals related to 'spoons of colorant' might be found. These timestamps are 00:00:50, 00:01:06, and 00:01:00.",
"Thought": "The next step is to use the query_GPT4_Vision tool to analyze the visuals at these timestamps. Starting with the first timestamp, 00:00:50, I will ask the tool to describe what is happening in the video clip at that time, focusing on the number of spoons of colorant.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_GPT4_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"timestamp": "00:00:50",
"query": "These are the still frames from a short video clip. How many spoons of colorant are being used?"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "Only one spoon of colorant is being used."}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The query_GPT4_Vision tool has confirmed that one spoon of colorant is being used in the video clip at the timestamp 00:00:50.",
"Thought": "Since the tool has provided a clear answer to the user's question, there is no need to analyze the visuals at the other timestamps. The answer to the user's question is that one spoon of colorant is required.",
"Answer": "One spoon of colorant is required."
