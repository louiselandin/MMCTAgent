{"Output": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600\nNow, we saw a ton of deer that afternoon and early the next morning and actually got a\n\n2\n00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,960\ncouple opportunities to get close, but Pete really never found another deer he got excited\n\n3\n00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,719\nabout until about 10 o'clock on the second morning and we came up on a cliff, almost\n\n4\n00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:23,040\na canyon looking situation with scrub brush down below us and Pete found Whopper Daddy\n\n5\n00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,360\nbedded under a bush.\n\n6\n00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,520\nIt was the buck of my dreams.\n\n7\n00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,959\nHe was a 4x4 with brow tines and he had velvet.\n\n8\n00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:34,040\nI told Pete, I said, Pete, if I've got my choice, I want one that's got velvet and he\n\n9\n00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,040\nfound it for me.\n\n10\n00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:43,200\nNow, it was just a matter of getting in on him.\n\n11\n00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,880\nOne of the things I'd like to clarify is the fact that in the West, they judge antlers\n\n12\n00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,680\na little different than we do.\n\n13\n00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,880\nYou'll hear them say a 4x4 or a 3x3 and basically, they're counting points on each side.\n\n14\n00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,000\nA 4x4 would be an eastern 8 point.\n\n15\n00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,240\nSo, when you're judging those animals and you hear them say a 4x4, to you and I, that's\n\n16\n00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,239\nan 8 pointer.\n\n17\n00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,199\nNow, I had read a little bit about stalking mule deer and I'd actually seen a couple of\n\n18\n00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:14,720\ntelevision shows where guys had used a bow and gotten really close to a mule deer and\n\n19\n00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,199\nthey all take off their boots and put on a heavy pair of socks and stalk that way and\n\n20\n00:01:20,199 --> 00:01:24,000\nI kind of thought it was a joke and that was the first thing that Pete told me when we\n\n21\n00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,879\nstarted stalking on this mule deer was that we're going to take our boots off, put on\n\n22\n00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,160\na heavy pair of socks and it'll really reduce our noise.\n\n23\n00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,160\nWell, the bad news is, is this is like desert country and you've got cactus and you've got\n\n24\n00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,879\nthistles and you've got yucca plants.\n\n25\n00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:44,199\nEverything that can stick or cut you is in the ground and the whole time you're walking,\n\n26\n00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:45,199\nyou're feeling it.\n\n27\n00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:51,000\nSo, it does cut down the noise, but boy, oh boy, is it hard on your feet.\n\n28\n00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,879\nAs soon as Pete saw this big buck behind the bush underneath, he motioned for me to crawl\n\n29\n00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:00,040\nup so I eased up to the edge of the rim rock and I pulled my glasses up and I looked over\n\n30\n00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,639\nand I was pretty excited.\n\n31\n00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:04,040\nI mean, that was the deer that I really wanted.\n\n32\n00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,199\nNow, the problem was how to get to him and we felt like it was best to actually back\n\n33\n00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,800\noff the cliff and circle way downwind and try to come in at the exact same level of\n\n34\n00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,839\nthe deer because we had a steep, steep bank, a steep canyon wall and then a flat bottom.\n\n35\n00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:24,320\nWe felt like with the deer positioned behind that bush, we could use that bush as cover\n\n36\n00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,919\nand come in right from behind him.\n\n37\n00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,559\nThe wind was right.\n\n38\n00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:30,080\nEverything seemed like it was going to be perfect to kill that deer.\n\n39\n00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,839\nNow, this was one of those stalks that seemed like it took four days.\n\n40\n00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:39,720\nWe came all the way down and around, probably two or three hundred yards and then got down\n\n41\n00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,240\non the flat and there wasn't a lot of cover so we were just picking and choosing our way\n\n42\n00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:50,000\nfrom bush to bush and basically, I'm trying to blend in behind Pete and I'm trying to\n\n43\n00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,240\nfollow his body language and his cues.\n\n44\n00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,199\nWhen he hesitates, I need to stop.\n\n45\n00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:58,320\nWhen he kneels down, I kneel down and that's exactly what you have to do when you're with\n\n46\n00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,479\na guide like that.\n\n47\n00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:03,600\nYou have to let him cue you in on every movement you need to make.\n\n48\n00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:10,559\nThe closer we got to the deer, it was becoming really obvious that that bush that was shielding\n\n49\n00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:15,440\nhim from us, it kept him from being able to see us, but it made it extremely hard for\n\n50\n00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,160\nus to see him and more importantly, get a shot.\n\n51\n00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,199\nSo we kept quartering left and right trying to jockey for position to where we could find\n\n52\n00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:29,119\none little lane that might give me an opportunity so when he stood up to adjust or to eat a\n\n53\n00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:31,639\nlittle bit, that I could slide an arrow in there.\n\n54\n00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:37,800\nAnd we're inside of 40 yards this whole time and then 30 and then 25 and now I've got nowhere\n\n55\n00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800\nelse to go.\n\n56\n00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,600\nI can't bridge that gap any further and I've still got a screen of bushes in front of me.\n\n57\n00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,039\nI was at one of those positions where I just really didn't know what to do.\n\n58\n00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:53,639\nPete actually sent me in that last 5 or 10 yards to get me inside a bow range and I kept\n\n59\n00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:58,880\nlooking back, really like a big brother, man I need some direction, what do I do?\n\n60\n00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,960\nAnd he and I both kind of saw the opportunity at the same time.\n\n61\n00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,279\nThere was like one little lane that fed right up to where the deer was bedded.\n\n62\n00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:11,440\nHe was actually pawed in and dug down into the dirt and Pete and I decided that we were\n\n63\n00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,679\ngoing to kind of get together and slide up into that lane and then set up a shooting\n\n64\n00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:17,720\nposition to where we could take the shot.\n\n65\n00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:23,880\nThe bad news is that when we made that move, there must have just been enough open between\n\n66\n00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:31,279\nthe deer's eye and us to give him that visual on us and man, he was gone and I mean gone.\n\n67\n00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,040\nWhen they see you or when they smell you, there's no hesitation.\n\n68\n00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,959\nThey are out of dodge.\n\n69\n00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:44,239\nOne of the things that I had the most difficulty getting used to being from the east was the\n\n70\n00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:47,119\namount of glassing that goes into hunting a mule deer.\n\n71\n00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:51,880\nYou're constantly with your spotting scope or with your binoculars looking for deer.\n\n72\n00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,440\nBack home, if you can see a deer 75 to 100 yards away, that's a long ways.\n\n73\n00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,119\nYou rarely ever use binoculars.\n\n74\n00:04:58,119 --> 00:05:03,119\nThese guys live with them on their chest and it's so important to have good optics and\n\n75\n00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:07,760\nbe able to see those deer a long ways away and pick your opportunities.\n\n76\n00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:14,600\nWe continued to see so many mule deer and actually had stalks every day on beautiful,\n\n77\n00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,480\nbeautiful bucks in decent spots, but there's so many variables to archery hunting.\n\n78\n00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,720\nWith gun hunting, you can sit back there at 100, 150 yards, get in position and make the\n\n79\n00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,880\nshot, but with bow hunting, everything's got to be right.\n\n80\n00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,880\nYou've got to be inside of 40 yards and you've got to have a clean area to the vitals and\n\n81\n00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,119\nI would get into situations where they would see me moving or maybe where the wind would\n\n82\n00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:44,119\nget me and I was in situations where one time, I was on a canyon cliff above a big mule deer\n\n83\n00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:50,440\nand I got so close to the deer that I could peek over and I could see the tips of his\n\n84\n00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,320\nfeet and I could hear him belching.\n\n85\n00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,040\nI was four yards from that deer and I still could not get an arrow into it.\n\n86\n00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,200\nTried to wait him out and eventually, that little freaky gust of wind came and boom,\n\n87\n00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,320\nhe was out of there.\n\n88\n00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,399\nYou might kind of think that was funny watching me run across the ridge in my little white\n\n89\n00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:12,200\nsocks trying to get a shot at that deer as he goes down the backside, but by that time,\n\n90\n00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,480\nI was pretty darn frustrated.\n\n\n\n"}
