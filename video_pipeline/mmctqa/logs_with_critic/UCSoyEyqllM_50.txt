"Observation": "The transcript does not contain any mention of Neymar or a penalty being scored. It seems to be lyrics to a song, which suggests that the video might be a music video or a montage. This means that the information about Neymar scoring a penalty is likely to be found in the visuals.",
"Thought": "Since the transcript does not provide any useful information for this question, I need to use the query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool to search the video frames for the moment Neymar scores his first penalty. Once I have the timestamp for this event, I can use the query_GPT4_Vision tool to analyze the visuals and determine the color of Neymar's shirt.",

"Thought": "I will now use the query_GPT4_Vision tool to analyze the visuals at these timestamps. I will start with the first timestamp '00:02:16'. I will ask the tool to describe Neymar's appearance, specifically focusing on the color of his shirt.",

Tool Output:
{"Output": "In the various still frames, Neymar is seen wearing a shirt that is primarily blue with red stripes.

After an unfruitful transcript search, the agent promptly switched to image analysis tools and successfully found the relevant visuals.", "Criteria 3": "There is no evidence of hallucination. The description of Neymar's attire matches the visual evidence provided in the images."}}
