User Input:
Adding what to the glass of red fluid, made the liquid burst out of the glass container?
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The user is asking about a specific event in the video where something was added to a glass of red fluid, causing the liquid to burst out of the glass container. This question requires understanding of both the visual and transcript modalities of the video.",
"Thought": "The first step is to get the transcript of the video to see if there is any mention of this event. If the transcript provides the answer, we can stop there. If not, we will need to use the other tools to analyze the visual content of the video.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "get_transcript",
"tool_input": {}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": ""}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The transcript of the video is empty. This indicates that the video does not contain any spoken words or the audio was not transcribed. Therefore, the answer to the user's question must be found in the visual content of the video.",
"Thought": "Since the transcript is empty, we need to analyze the visual content of the video. We can use the query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool to find the moment in the video where something is added to a glass of red fluid. The query should be related to the user's question.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"frames_query": "adding to red fluid in glass"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "00:00:21, 00:00:29, 00:01:57"}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool has returned three timestamps: 00:00:21, 00:00:29, and 00:01:57. These timestamps represent the top three frames that match the query 'adding to red fluid in glass'.",
"Thought": "We should now use the query_GPT4_Vision tool to analyze the visual content at these timestamps. We will start with the first timestamp (00:00:21) as it is the highest match to the search query. We will ask the tool to describe what is happening in the video clip at this timestamp, specifically focusing on what is being added to the red fluid in the glass.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_GPT4_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"timestamp": "00:00:21",
"query": "These are the still frames from a short video clip. Can you describe what is being added to the red fluid in the glass?"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "Vinegar is being added to the glass with red fluid."}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "According to the output from the query_GPT4_Vision tool, vinegar is being added to the glass with red fluid at the timestamp 00:00:21.",
"Thought": "This information directly answers the user's question. We now know that vinegar was added to the glass of red fluid, causing the liquid to burst out of the glass container.",
"Answer": "Vinegar was added to the glass of red fluid, causing the liquid to burst out of the glass container."
}
Critic Feedback:
{"Critic Feedback": {"Criteria 1": "The system adequately answered the user query with 'vinegar' causing the red fluid to burst out of the glass container. The response seems correct as per the visual evidence from the images provided.", "Criteria 2": "The thoroughness of the reasoning chain is adequate. The omission of a transcript forced the system to rely solely on visual tools. Multiple timestamps were obtained and one was analyzed in detail, which is a sound approach given the lack of audio-based data.", "Criteria 3": "The images provided for 00:00:21 include text clearly stating 'Some Vinegar...', which corresponds directly with the output provided by the query_GPT4_Vision tool. There is no evidence of hallucination in this case, as the provided images substantiate the claim."}}
