User Input:
How do people in the west, judge an antler? 
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The user is asking about how people in the western culture judge or evaluate an antler. This could refer to the process of scoring antlers in hunting or wildlife management, or it could refer to the cultural significance of antlers in the west. The answer could be present in the transcript or the visuals of the video.",
"Thought": "The first step is to get the transcript of the video to see if it contains any information about how people in the west judge an antler. If the transcript contains relevant information, it can be used to answer the question directly or to guide further investigation into the visuals.",

{"Output": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600\nNow, we saw a ton of deer that afternoon and early the next morning and actually got a\n\n2\n00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,960\ncouple opportunities to get close, but Pete really never found another deer he got excited\n\n3\n00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,719\nabout until about 10 o'clock on the second morning and we came up on a cliff, almost\n\n4\n00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:23,040\na canyon looking situation with scrub brush down below us and Pete found Whopper Daddy\n\n5\n00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,360\nbedded under a bush.\n\n6\n00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,520\nIt was the buck of my dreams.\n\n7\n00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,959\nHe was a 4x4 with brow tines and he had velvet.\n\n8\n00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:34,040\nI told Pete, I said, Pete, if I've got my choice, I want one that's got velvet and he\n\n9\n00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,040\nfound it for me.\n\n10\n00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:43,200\nNow, it was just a matter of getting in on him.\n\n11\n00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,880\nOne of the things I'd like to clarify is the fact that in the West, they judge antlers\n\n12\n00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,680\na little different than we do.\n\n13\n00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,880\nYou'll hear them say a 4x4 or a 3x3 and basically, they're counting points on each side.\n\n14\n00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,000\nA 4x4 would be an eastern 8 point.\n\n15\n00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,240\nSo, when you're judging those animals and you hear them say a 4x4, to you and I, that's\n\n16\n00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,239\nan 8 pointer.\n\n17\n00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,199\nNow, I had read a little bit about stalking mule deer and I'd actually seen a couple of\n\n18\n00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:14,720\ntelevision shows where guys had used a bow and gotten really close to a mule deer and\n\n19\n00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,199\nthey all take off their boots and put on a heavy pair of socks and stalk that way and\n\n20\n00:01:20,199 --> 00:01:24,000\nI kind of thought it was a joke and that was the first thing that Pete told me when we\n\n21\n00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,879\nstarted stalking on this mule deer was that we're going to take our boots off, put on\n\n22\n00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,160\na heavy pair of socks and it'll really reduce our noise.\n\n23\n00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,160\nWell, the bad news is, is this is like desert country and you've got cactus and you've got\n\n24\n00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,879\nthistles and you've got yucca plants.\n\n25\n00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:44,199\nEverything that can stick or cut you is in the ground and the whole time you're walking,\n\n26\n00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:45,199\nyou're feeling it.\n\n27\n00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:51,000\nSo, it does cut down the noise, but boy, oh boy, is it hard on your feet.\n\n28\n00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,879\nAs soon as Pete saw this big buck behind the bush underneath, he motioned for me to crawl\n\n29\n00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:00,040\nup so I eased up to the edge of the rim rock and I pulled my glasses up and I looked over\n\n30\n00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,639\nand I was pretty excited.\n\n31\n00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:04,040\nI mean, that was the deer that I really wanted.\n\n32\n00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,199\nNow, the problem was how to get to him and we felt like it was best to actually back\n\n33\n00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,800\noff the cliff and circle way downwind and try to come in at the exact same level of\n\n34\n00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,839\nthe deer because we had a steep, steep bank, a steep canyon wall and then a flat bottom.\n\n35\n00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:24,320\nWe felt like with the deer positioned behind that bush, we could use that bush as cover\n\n36\n00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,919\nand come in right from behind him.\n\n37\n00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,559\nThe wind was right.\n\n38\n00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:30,080\nEverything seemed like it was going to be perfect to kill that deer.\n\n39\n00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,839\nNow, this was one of those stalks that seemed like it took four days.\n\n40\n00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:39,720\nWe came all the way down and around, probably two or three hundred yards and then got down\n\n41\n00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,240\non the flat and there wasn't a lot of cover so we were just picking and choosing our way\n\n42\n00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:50,000\nfrom bush to bush and basically, I'm trying to blend in behind Pete and I'm trying to\n\n43\n00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,240\nfollow his body language and his cues.\n\n44\n00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,199\nWhen he hesitates, I need to stop.\n\n45\n00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:58,320\nWhen he kneels down, I kneel down and that's exactly what you have to do when you're with\n\n46\n00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,479\na guide like that.\n\n47\n00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:03,600\nYou have to let him cue you in on every movement you need to make.\n\n48\n00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:10,559\nThe closer we got to the deer, it was becoming really obvious that that bush that was shielding\n\n49\n00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:15,440\nhim from us, it kept him from being able to see us, but it made it extremely hard for\n\n50\n00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,160\nus to see him and more importantly, get a shot.\n\n51\n00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,199\nSo we kept quartering left and right trying to jockey for position to where we could find\n\n52\n00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:29,119\none little lane that might give me an opportunity so when he stood up to adjust or to eat a\n\n53\n00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:31,639\nlittle bit, that I could slide an arrow in there.\n\n54\n00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:37,800\nAnd we're inside of 40 yards this whole time and then 30 and then 25 and now I've got nowhere\n\n55\n00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800\nelse to go.\n\n56\n00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,600\nI can't bridge that gap any further and I've still got a screen of bushes in front of me.\n\n57\n00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,039\nI was at one of those positions where I just really didn't know what to do.\n\n58\n00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:53,639\nPete actually sent me in that last 5 or 10 yards to get me inside a bow range and I kept\n\n59\n00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:58,880\nlooking back, really like a big brother, man I need some direction, what do I do?\n\n60\n00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,960\nAnd he and I both kind of saw the opportunity at the same time.\n\n61\n00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,279\nThere was like one little lane that fed right up to where the deer was bedded.\n\n62\n00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:11,440\nHe was actually pawed in and dug down into the dirt and Pete and I decided that we were\n\n63\n00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,679\ngoing to kind of get together and slide up into that lane and then set up a shooting\n\n64\n00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:17,720\nposition to where we could take the shot.\n\n65\n00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:23,880\nThe bad news is that when we made that move, there must have just been enough open between\n\n66\n00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:31,279\nthe deer's eye and us to give him that visual on us and man, he was gone and I mean gone.\n\n67\n00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,040\nWhen they see you or when they smell you, there's no hesitation.\n\n68\n00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,959\nThey are out of dodge.\n\n69\n00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:44,239\nOne of the things that I had the most difficulty getting used to being from the east was the\n\n70\n00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:47,119\namount of glassing that goes into hunting a mule deer.\n\n71\n00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:51,880\nYou're constantly with your spotting scope or with your binoculars looking for deer.\n\n72\n00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,440\nBack home, if you can see a deer 75 to 100 yards away, that's a long ways.\n\n73\n00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,119\nYou rarely ever use binoculars.\n\n74\n00:04:58,119 --> 00:05:03,119\nThese guys live with them on their chest and it's so important to have good optics and\n\n75\n00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:07,760\nbe able to see those deer a long ways away and pick your opportunities.\n\n76\n00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:14,600\nWe continued to see so many mule deer and actually had stalks every day on beautiful,\n\n77\n00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,480\nbeautiful bucks in decent spots, but there's so many variables to archery hunting.\n\n78\n00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,720\nWith gun hunting, you can sit back there at 100, 150 yards, get in position and make the\n\n79\n00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,880\nshot, but with bow hunting, everything's got to be right.\n\n80\n00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,880\nYou've got to be inside of 40 yards and you've got to have a clean area to the vitals and\n\n81\n00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,119\nI would get into situations where they would see me moving or maybe where the wind would\n\n82\n00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:44,119\nget me and I was in situations where one time, I was on a canyon cliff above a big mule deer\n\n83\n00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:50,440\nand I got so close to the deer that I could peek over and I could see the tips of his\n\n84\n00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,320\nfeet and I could hear him belching.\n\n85\n00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,040\nI was four yards from that deer and I still could not get an arrow into it.\n\n86\n00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,200\nTried to wait him out and eventually, that little freaky gust of wind came and boom,\n\n87\n00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,320\nhe was out of there.\n\n88\n00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,399\nYou might kind of think that was funny watching me run across the ridge in my little white\n\n89\n00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:12,200\nsocks trying to get a shot at that deer as he goes down the backside, but by that time,\n\n90\n00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,480\nI was pretty darn frustrated.\n\n\n\n"}

The deer is identifiable by its silhouette, and especially, in frames eight and nine, you can see its prominent antlers highlighted against the light-colored sky.\n\n5. In the tenth frame, the deer's stance changes slightly, it looks more alerted or has turned its body slightly, as if reacting to the surroundings.\n\nWhile the activity of evaluating antlers is not directly depicted, the context and equipment suggest that the individuals might be assessing the deer, possibly for its suitability as game based on the size and configuration of its antlers. The person with the bow is likely preparing for a shot or just observing the deer through binoculars, while the second individual seems to be pointing it out and likely helping in judging the distance or the size of the antlers."}

Tool Output:
{"Output": "In the series of still frames provided, the following sequence of events appears to take place:\n\n1-4. These images capture a person in mid-speech, and judging from their hand gestures and facial expressions, it seems they are talking, possibly explaining or narrating something. The individual is outdoors and wearing a cap and outdoor attire.\n\n5-8. These frames show a deer, camouflaged among the trees and shrubbery. The focus is on the deer's head, specifically its antlers, which are prominent and extend high above its head.\n\n9. The last frame features two individuals hidden in tall grass. They are wearing camouflaged clothing, and one is using binoculars, likely observing or evaluating the deer from a distance.\n\nBased on the context provided by the images, it appears that the individuals in the last frame may be assessing the deer's antlers, possibly for hunting purposes or wildlife study. The person speaking in the first four frames could be describing the process of locating and evaluating the deer, which aligns with the subsequent images of deer observation. The setting is consistent with an outdoor, wilderness area conducive for wildlife observation."}

"Observation": "The output from the query_GPT4_Vision tool indicates that the visuals at the timestamp 00:00:29 show a sequence of events where individuals are observing and potentially evaluating a deer, specifically focusing on its antlers. The first few images show a person in mid-speech, possibly explaining or narrating something. The next few images show a deer, camouflaged among the trees and shrubbery, with the focus on the deer's head, specifically its antlers. The last image features two individuals hidden in tall grass, one of them using binoculars, likely observing or evaluating the deer from a distance.",
"Thought": "The visuals at this timestamp provide some additional context about the setting and activities related to observing and potentially judging or evaluating the antlers of a deer. However, they do not provide direct visual information about the specific process or criteria used to judge antlers in the West. Based on the information available from the transcript and the visuals analyzed so far, I can provide a partial answer to the user's question.",
"Answer": "People in the West judge antlers by counting the points on each side, referring to them as 4x4 or 3x3, for example. This is different from other regions where they might refer to a 4x4 as an 8 point. The visuals in the video show individuals observing a deer and potentially evaluating its antlers, but they do not provide direct visual information about the specific process or criteria used to judge antlers in the West. Therefore, the specific process or criteria used to judge antlers in the West could not be directly ascertained from the visuals in the video."
