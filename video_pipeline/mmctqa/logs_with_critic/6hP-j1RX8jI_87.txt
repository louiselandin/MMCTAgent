{"Output": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120\nHi, I'm Christy with Duck Brand Duct Tape. Today I'm going to show you how to make\n\n2\n00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,720\na holiday tree ornament. This is an advanced craft that should take about\n\n3\n00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:16,400\n45 minutes to complete. The materials you need for this project are green, red, and\n\n4\n00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,400\nchrome duct tape, a green pipe cleaner,\n\n5\n00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:28,360\nposter board, and scissors. For the first step, take your poster board and wrap it\n\n6\n00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:34,560\ninto a small cone that will be the shape of your holiday tree. And then cut along\n\n7\n00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,840\nthe bottom so you have a flat surface, which actually is about the size of this right\n\n8\n00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,360\nhere. And I've already gone ahead and covered the entire cone with green duct\n\n9\n00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,240\ntape. Next, we are going to make the duct tape loops that are the branches on your\n\n10\n00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:57,240\ntree. So again, I'm working with green and I'm going to pull off about 12 inches of\n\n11\n00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:05,440\nduct tape and lay it sticky side up, flat on your cutting board. I'm going to rip the\n\n12\n00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:11,080\nsame amount of tape, again about 12 inches, and I'm going to lay it sticky side to\n\n13\n00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:16,919\nsticky side to create a duct tape fabric. I'm going to trim the edges off here\n\n14\n00:01:16,919 --> 00:01:23,720\nbecause my second piece was a little bit shorter. And now you have a two-sided\n\n15\n00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:28,800\nstrip of duct tape. And I'm going to cut this into thirds, so making two cuts, one\n\n16\n00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,199\nhere and one here. It's okay if they're not all perfectly even because we are\n\n17\n00:01:34,199 --> 00:01:38,160\ngoing to be folding them over and you won't notice anyways. So I'm taking my three\n\n18\n00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:43,599\nstrips and just stacking them on top of each other. And now I'm going to cut two-inch\n\n19\n00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:49,120\nsections of the strip to create the individual loops. I have now taken a piece\n\n20\n00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:55,919\nof duct tape about five inches long and ripped it into thirds. So I have it laying\n\n21\n00:01:55,919 --> 00:02:01,360\nsticky side up and I'm taking one of my two-inch pieces of double-sided tape that\n\n22\n00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:09,240\nwe just made and first laying it down about halfway through the middle of the\n\n23\n00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:16,600\ntape and then the bottom half right above it, still leaving a layer of adhesive on\n\n24\n00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:23,639\ntop running along. And we'll continue to do this, leaving a little bit of a gap in\n\n25\n00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:30,119\nbetween each of the pieces that you put on there, running all along to the end of\n\n26\n00:02:30,119 --> 00:02:36,039\nthe piece of tape. Now I have a couple of these completed so I'll start to show\n\n27\n00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:40,479\nyou how to actually apply it to the cone. And we're going to start at the bottom. So\n\n28\n00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:45,160\nlining up the bottom of the loop with the bottom of the tree, stick the tape on like\n\n29\n00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:50,520\nthat and work all the way around the bottom. I think that would be the easiest way. Once\n\n30\n00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,119\nyou reach the second layer, just like we've done in our sample, we overlaid the\n\n31\n00:02:55,119 --> 00:03:00,240\nloops in between the one that's right below it so you have a layered look. And I'm\n\n32\n00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,119\njust going to continue to do this until my entire cone is covered with loops. The\n\n33\n00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:10,320\nnext step is to create the hook where you can actually hang it on a tree. So I'm\n\n34\n00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,559\nstarting with a piece of pipe cleaner and I'm going to cut about four to five\n\n35\n00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:21,240\ninches off and going to fold it into a loop and just put it on top of the tree.\n\n36\n00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:26,440\nI've also already ripped off a small piece of duct tape and then ripped it in\n\n37\n00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,440\nhalf so it's a little bit thinner. And I'm just going to wrap this around and\n\n38\n00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,880\ntape the pipe cleaner to the top of the tree. I already went ahead and created\n\n39\n00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:41,360\nlittle ornaments that were just from a duct tape sheet that I cut out into\n\n40\n00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,279\nsquares. If you can't find a sheet or you don't have one, you can also just roll\n\n41\n00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:50,119\nout duct tape and use a crafting knife or scissors to cut the little pieces out.\n\n42\n00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:57,839\nI also actually made a star and I'm just sticking it to the top. And that's how\n\n43\n00:03:57,839 --> 00:03:59,600\nyou make a holiday tree ornament.\n\n\n\n"}

"Observation": "The transcript provides a detailed step-by-step process of creating a holiday tree ornament using duct tape. The artist first creates a cone shape with poster board and covers it with green duct tape. Then, the artist creates loops from the duct tape to form the branches of the tree. After adding layers of loops to the tree, the artist creates a hook using a pipe cleaner to hang the ornament. Then, the artist adds ornaments made from duct tape sheets cut into squares and a star at the top.",
"Thought": "The user's question is about what the artist did after adding layers of loops to create the leaves of the Christmas tree. From the transcript, it is clear that after adding the layers of loops, the artist created a hook using a pipe cleaner for hanging the ornament. Then, the artist added ornaments made from duct tape sheets cut into squares and a star at the top. Therefore, the answer to the user's question can be directly extracted from the transcript without the need for further tools.",
