GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The user wants a summary of the main steps involved in the process shown in the video and how these steps are interconnected. The options suggest that the video could be about making a smoothie, a cake, painting a pot, making a pizza, or making a sandwich.",
"Thought": "I need to identify the main activity in the video first. I can use the query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool with a search query that includes all the possible activities mentioned in the options. Once I have the timestamps, I can use the query_GPT4_Vision tool to verify the activity and get more details about the process and how the steps are interconnected.",

"tool_input": 
{
"frames_query":"making smoothie, making cake, painting pot, making pizza, making sandwich"

Tool Output:
{"Output": "00:02:15, 00:01:00, 00:02:58"}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The tool has returned three timestamps: 00:02:15, 00:01:00, and 00:02:58. These timestamps represent the top three matches for the search query.",
"Thought": "I should now use the query_GPT4_Vision tool to verify the activity happening at these timestamps. I will start with the first timestamp, 00:02:15, as it is the highest match. I will ask the tool to describe the activity in the frames around this timestamp.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_GPT4_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"timestamp":"00:02:15",
"query":"These are the still frames from a short video clip. Describe the activity in these frames."
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "The frames depict a person engaged in an art-related activity, specifically painting. \n\n1. In the first frame, the person appears to be pouring blue paint from a small container onto a palette that already has some yellow paint splattered on it.\n\n2. The second frame displays the individual dipping a paintbrush into the blue paint that is now on the palette.\n\n3. Continuing with the activity, the third and fourth frames show the person preparing to paint, holding the brush close to the palette, more poised to begin the artistic process.\n\n4. The person seems to pause in the fifth and sixth frames, as they are seen to be reaching for a smartphone which was initially resting on the table.\n\n5. From the seventh to the ninth frame, the individual is holding their phone and appears to be either looking at something or using it, possibly taking a break from painting or searching for a reference for their artwork.\n\n6. The person puts the phone back down on the table in the tenth frame and seems to be turning the phone screen away, perhaps concluding the interaction with the phone and possibly ready to resume painting.\n\nThroughout the frames, we see a close-up of the actions with the focus on the person's hands, the paint, and the paintbrush, against the backdrop of a domestic environment. There is a soft glow, presumably from a lamp, adding warmth to the setting. It captures a moment of creativity often interspersed with the use of technology, highlighting a glimpse of the modern creative process."}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The output from the query_GPT4_Vision tool describes a person engaged in an art-related activity, specifically painting. The person is seen pouring paint, preparing to paint, taking a break to use their phone, and then preparing to resume painting.",
"Thought": "Based on the output, it seems that the video is about painting a pot, as this is the only option related to painting. The detailed description of the process also allows us to understand how the steps are interconnected. The person prepares the paint, starts painting, takes a break to use their phone, and then resumes painting. This suggests a cycle of work and rest in the creative process.",
"Answer": "Option 2: 1. the person in the video is painting a pot."
