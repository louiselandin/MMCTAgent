User Input:
What is written on the tshirt of the person?
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The user is asking about the text on a person's t-shirt in the video. This information is not directly available and needs to be extracted from the video frames.",
"Thought": "The first step is to get the transcript of the video to see if there is any mention of the text on the t-shirt. If not, we will need to use the visual tools to extract this information.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "get_transcript",
"tool_input": {}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": ""}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The transcript of the video is empty, which means there is no spoken content in the video or the audio is not clear enough to generate a transcript.",
"Thought": "Since the transcript is empty, we need to rely on the visual content of the video to answer the user's question. We can use the query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool to find the frames where a person's t-shirt is visible and then use query_GPT4_Vision to read the text on the t-shirt.",
"Action":

"tool_name": "query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision",

Tool Output:
{"Output": "00:00:17, 00:00:00, 00:00:04"}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool has returned three timestamps where a person's t-shirt is likely visible in the video. The timestamps are 00:00:17, 00:00:00, and 00:00:04.",
"Thought": "We should now use the query_GPT4_Vision tool to analyze the frames at these timestamps and try to read the text on the t-shirt. We will start with the first timestamp, which is 00:00:17.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_GPT4_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"timestamp": "00:00:17",
"query": "These are the still frames from a short video clip. Is there any text visible on the person's t-shirt? If yes, what does it say?"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "Yes, there is text visible on the person's t-shirt across all the frames provided. The text says, \"Cbar Project.\""}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The query_GPT4_Vision tool has confirmed that there is text visible on the person's t-shirt in the frames around the timestamp 00:00:17. The text on the t-shirt reads \"Cbar Project.\"",
"Thought": "We have successfully found the information the user was asking for. There is no need to analyze the frames at the other timestamps.",
"Answer": "The text written on the person's t-shirt is \"Cbar Project.\""
