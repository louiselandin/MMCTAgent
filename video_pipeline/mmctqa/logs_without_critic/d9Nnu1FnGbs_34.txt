Where is the robot standing?
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The user is asking about the location of a robot in the video. This question requires visual analysis as the location of the robot can't be determined from the transcript alone.",
"Thought": "First, I will get the transcript of the video to see if there is any mention of the robot's location. If the transcript doesn't provide the necessary information, I will use the visual analysis tools to find the answer.",
