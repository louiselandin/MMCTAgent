User Input:
How does the color inside the glass of vinegar change, when food colorant was added?
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The user is asking about a specific event in the video where food colorant is added to a glass of vinegar. They want to know how the color inside the glass changes as a result.",
"Thought": "The first step is to get the transcript of the video to see if there is any mention of the color change when food colorant is added to vinegar. This will help us understand the context and possibly answer the question directly if the information is present in the transcript.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "get_transcript",
"tool_input": 
{
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": ""}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The transcript of the video is empty, which means the video does not contain any spoken or written text.",
"Thought": "Since the transcript is empty, we need to rely on the visual content of the video to answer the question. We can use the query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool to find the moment when the food colorant is added to the vinegar. The query should be related to the user's question about the color change in the glass of vinegar.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"frames_query": "food colorant added to vinegar"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "00:01:05, 00:00:26, 00:00:29"}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The tool has returned three timestamps: 00:01:05, 00:00:26, and 00:00:29. These are the moments in the video that the tool has identified as most closely matching the query about food colorant being added to vinegar.",
"Thought": "We should now use the query_GPT4_Vision tool to analyze the visuals at these timestamps. We'll start with the first timestamp (00:01:05) and ask the tool to describe the color change in the glass of vinegar when the food colorant is added.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_GPT4_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"timestamp": "00:01:05",
"query": "These are the still frames from a short video clip. Can you describe how the color inside the glass of vinegar changes when food colorant is added?"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "The glass is full of vinegar, with the color of a really weak tea. The food colorant comes from a white bottle and has a deep red color. When dropped into the vinegar, the food colorant spreads unevenly, as it is heavier than the vinegar."}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The tool describes that the vinegar in the glass has the color of weak tea. When the deep red food colorant is added, it spreads unevenly in the vinegar because it is heavier.",
"Thought": "This information directly answers the user's question about how the color inside the glass of vinegar changes when food colorant is added. The color changes from a weak tea color to a deeper red as the colorant spreads unevenly in the vinegar.",
"Answer": "When the food colorant is added to the glass of vinegar, the color changes from a weak tea color to a deeper red. The colorant spreads unevenly in the vinegar because it is heavier."
