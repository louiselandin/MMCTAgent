User Input:
Question: If you were to condense the primary actions of the video into a single objective or process, what would that be?
Option 0: Moving the chair.
Option 1: Touching the shelf.
Option 2: Touching the cat.
Option 3: Cleaning the floor.
Option 4: Moving the guitar bag.
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The question asks for the primary action or objective of the video. The options suggest various activities such as moving objects, touching objects or cleaning. To answer this question, we need to understand the main activity happening in the video.",
"Thought": "Since the question is about the primary action in the video, we need to identify the most recurring or significant activity. We can use the query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool with queries related to the options to find the timestamps where these activities occur. We can start with the first option 'Moving the chair' and then proceed with the others.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"frames_query":"Moving the chair"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "00:01:38, 00:00:36, 00:02:20"}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The tool returned three timestamps where the action 'Moving the chair' is likely to occur. These timestamps are spread throughout the video, suggesting that this action might be a recurring activity.",
"Thought": "To confirm whether 'Moving the chair' is indeed the primary action of the video, we should use the query_GPT4_Vision tool to analyze the frames around these timestamps. We can start with the first timestamp '00:01:38'.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_GPT4_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"timestamp":"00:01:38",
"query":"These are the still frames from a short video clip. Describe the activity in these frames."
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "The sequence of frames depicts a person, likely holding the recording device, engaging in the activity of cleaning a floor using a flat mop. The mop has a white cleaning pad attached to its blue handle. We see the cleaner's movements as they work the mop back and forth across the wooden floor, which appears to be in a residential setting. The cleaner is presumably making efforts to maintain or restore cleanliness to the flooring area shown."}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The GPT4 Vision tool describes a person cleaning the floor with a mop in the frames around the timestamp '00:01:38'. There is no mention of moving a chair in this description.",
"Thought": "The primary action at this timestamp is not 'Moving the chair' but 'Cleaning the floor'. However, this is just one timestamp and the primary action might vary across the video. We should check the other timestamps returned by the query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool for 'Moving the chair'. Let's proceed with the second timestamp '00:00:36'.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_GPT4_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"timestamp":"00:00:36",
"query":"These are the still frames from a short video clip. Describe the activity in these frames."
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "The series of frames depict someone vacuuming and cleaning a room. From the first to the fourth frame, the person is seen using a vacuum cleaner with a long handle. They are vacuuming the floor, navigating around a chair and what looks like a shelf with various items and books.\n\nIn the fifth frame, the activity changes slightly; the person appears to be using the vacuum cleaner's nozzle to suction along the edge of a couch or a cushioned seat. In this frame, they have removed the long handle and are using the shorter nozzle for more precision.\n\nFrames six to eight show the person continuing to vacuum around objects in the room. They appear to be making sure to reach corners and edges where dust often accumulates.\n\nIn frames nine and ten, the focus shifts to the person using their hand to adjust or move something on the edge of a seat or couch, possibly to vacuum underneath it better. The last frame shows a cat on the couch, which might suggest the person was attempting to clean pet hair or make space to continue cleaning. Overall, these frames capture a typical cleaning routine involving the thorough vacuuming of a living space."}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The GPT4 Vision tool describes a person vacuuming and cleaning a room in the frames around the timestamp '00:00:36'. There is mention of navigating around a chair, but the primary action is still cleaning, not moving the chair.",
"Thought": "The primary action at this timestamp is also not 'Moving the chair' but 'Cleaning the floor'. It seems like 'Cleaning the floor' might be the primary action of the video. However, to be sure, we should check the last timestamp '00:02:20' returned by the query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool for 'Moving the chair'.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_GPT4_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"timestamp":"00:02:20",
"query":"These are the still frames from a short video clip. Describe the activity in these frames."
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "The activity shown in these frames is someone using a mop with a long handle to clean a wooden floor inside a home. The person seems to be methodically moving the mop back and forth across the floor, navigating around furniture such as chairs and possibly other objects on the floor. This is indicated by the changing orientation and position of the mop in relation to the furniture and by the motion blur of the mop and the person's arms, suggesting the action of mopping. The angle of the shot is downward, likely taken from a head-mounted or chest-mounted camera perspective, which captures the arms of the person and the top of the mop as they perform the cleaning task."}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The GPT4 Vision tool describes a person cleaning the floor with a mop in the frames around the timestamp '00:02:20'. There is mention of navigating around furniture, but the primary action is still cleaning, not moving the chair.",
"Thought": "The primary action at all three timestamps is 'Cleaning the floor', not 'Moving the chair'. This suggests that 'Cleaning the floor' is the primary action of the video. Therefore, the answer to the question is 'Cleaning the floor'.",
"Answer": "Option 3: Cleaning the floor."
