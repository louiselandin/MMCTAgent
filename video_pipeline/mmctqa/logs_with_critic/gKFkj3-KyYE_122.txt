User Input:
What happened after the character with the yellow shirt sat down at the table?
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The user is asking about a specific event that happened after a character with a yellow shirt sat down at a table. This question requires understanding of both the video's transcript and visuals.",
"Thought": "First, I will retrieve the transcript of the video to see if there is any mention of a character with a yellow shirt sitting at a table. If the transcript provides enough information, I can answer the question directly. If not, I will need to use the visual analysis tools to find the relevant scene and analyze it.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "get_transcript",
"tool_input": {}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": ""}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The transcript of the video is empty. This means that the video does not contain any spoken words or the audio was not transcribed.",
"Thought": "Since the transcript is empty, I will need to rely on visual analysis to answer the user's question. I will use the query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool to search for the moment when a character with a yellow shirt sits at a table.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"frames_query": "character with yellow shirt sitting at table"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "00:02:02, 00:01:02, 00:01:41"}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool has returned three timestamps: 00:02:02, 00:01:02, and 00:01:41. These timestamps represent the top three frames that match the query 'character with yellow shirt sitting at table'.",
"Thought": "I will use the query_GPT4_Vision tool to analyze the first timestamp (00:02:02) to understand what happens after the character with the yellow shirt sits at the table. If this does not provide a satisfactory answer, I will proceed to analyze the next timestamps.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_GPT4_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"timestamp": "00:02:02",
"query": "These are the still frames from a short video clip. What happens immediately after the character with the yellow shirt sits at the table?"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "Immediately after the character in the yellow shirt sits at the table, they appear to take a rectangular object which seems to be a tablet or large smartphone. They begin to interact with the device, holding it with both hands and attentively looking at its screen. The surrounding environment does not show any significant changes, and the other individuals in the scene continue with their activities without apparent interaction with the character in the yellow shirt."}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "According to the output from the query_GPT4_Vision tool, after the character in the yellow shirt sits at the table, they take a rectangular object, which seems to be a tablet or large smartphone, and begin to interact with it.

The agent described the actions of the character with a yellow shirt after sitting at the table, which included interacting with a tablet, as confirmed by the provided images.", "Criteria 2": "The reasoning chain was comprehensive. The agent made good use of the visual analysis tool to find the relevant scene after discovering the transcript was empty. The system proceeded to accurately analyze the scene using the query_GPT4_Vision tool, which indicates diligence in attempting to answer the query despite the lack of transcript data.", "Criteria 3": "There is no evidence of hallucination. The analysis performed using the query_GPT4_Vision tool is consistent with the actual contents of the images provided, suggesting an accurate assessment of the relevant video frames."}}
