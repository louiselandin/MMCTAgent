Question: Based on the video's content, describe the primary purpose of the actions performed by the character throughout the video. do not list the actions, but instead, provide a summary that highlights the overall goal.
Option 0: Based on the video's content, the primary purpose of the actions performed by the character throughout the video is to read the books.
Option 1: Based on the video's content, the primary purpose of the actions performed by the character throughout the video is to organize the books.
Option 2: Based on the video's content, the primary purpose of the actions performed by the character throughout the video is to get rid of the books.
Option 3: Based on the video's content, the primary purpose of the actions performed by the character throughout the video is to show off the books.

GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The user wants to know the primary purpose of the actions performed by the character in the video. The options suggest that the character is interacting with books in some way.",
"Thought": "Since the question is about the overall goal of the character's actions, I need to understand the context of the character's interaction with the books. I will use the query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool to find frames where the character is interacting with the books. Based on the options, a good search query could be 'character interacting with books'.",

"Observation": "The tool has returned three timestamps where the character is interacting with the books. These timestamps are likely to contain the key actions that will help determine the character's overall goal.",
"Thought": "I will use the query_GPT4_Vision tool to analyze the first timestamp (00:02:18). I will ask the tool to describe what is happening in the frames around this timestamp. This should give me a better understanding of the character's actions and their purpose.",

Tool Output:
{"Output": "The sequence of images depicts a person seated on the floor, surrounded by stacks of books. The individual is engaged in the process of sorting, flipping through, examining, and possibly selecting books. The surroundings look quite cluttered, indicating that this might be a setting that's used for storage or perhaps where the person sorts through various items, possibly for categorization or organization.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. The first frame shows the person reaching out towards a stack of books.\n2. In the second frame, they have selected a book with an image of a woman on the cover.\n3. The third frame shows the person holding a book with a yellowish cover that has text, although the exact wording is not clear.\n4. In the fourth and fifth frames, the person flips through another book\u2014revealing its pages and text content.\n5. The sixth and seventh frames have the person turning a book over in hand, continuing to examine its contents.\n6. In the eighth frame, the person seems to be placing or picking up books from the floor to the left.\n7. The ninth frame shows the person reaching out to probably grab more books from a stack.\n8. And in the final frame, the person holds a different book, this time with a cheetah on the cover, possibly to inspect it further or add it to a selected pile.\n\nOverall, the activity appears to be focused on reviewing books, potentially for sorting, organizing, or even packing."}

"Thought": "Based on the detailed description of the frames, it seems that the character is not just reading, showing off, getting rid of, or cleaning the books. The character is actively sorting, examining, and possibly selecting books, which aligns with the action of organizing the books.",
"Answer": "Option 1: Based on the video's content, the primary purpose of the actions performed by the character throughout the video is to organize the books."
