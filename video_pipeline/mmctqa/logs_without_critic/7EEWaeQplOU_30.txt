How many books were there on the table?

Tool Output:
{"Output": "In the series of frames provided, it appears that the first few do not contain any clear images of books on a table. However, the fifth image displays a room with a table that has three visible sides. On top of this table, there seems to be an arrangement of objects that may include books, but the view is partly obscured by what looks like a folded cloth or cover. From this angle and with the partial view, it is not possible to confirm the number of books or provide specific details about them.\n\nIf you have additional images or angles that show the table more clearly, I could offer a more precise count of the books present."}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The tool was unable to confirm the number of books on the table at the timestamp '00:01:43' due to an obscured view.",
"Thought": "Since the first timestamp did not provide a clear view of the books on the table, I will now analyze the visuals at the second timestamp '00:00:16' using the query_GPT4_Vision tool.",

GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The tool did not find any books on the table at the timestamp '00:00:16'.",

Tool Output:
{"Output": "I have thoroughly examined all the provided still frames and there are no books visible on any table in these images. The frames mostly focus on a foldable sofa bed mechanism, both in a closed position and partly unfolded. There is also a background featuring a room, but no books can be seen on any tables within these frames."}
GPT-4 Output:

"Observation": "The tool did not find any books on the table at the timestamp '00:01:08'.",
