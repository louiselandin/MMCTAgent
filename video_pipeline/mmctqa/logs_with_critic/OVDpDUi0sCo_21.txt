GPT-4 Output:

"Observation": "The transcript seems to be from a cricket match featuring Brian Lara. There is a mention of Lara nicking the ball and getting out ('And he's nicked it and gone.') around the timestamp 00:01:47,000. However, there is no explicit mention of what the wicketkeeper did after catching the ball.",
"Thought": "Since the transcript does not provide a direct answer to the user's question, I need to retrieve the relevant visual information. The event of interest likely occurred around the time when Lara got out. I will use the query_transcript tool to find the timestamps related to this event.",

Tool Output:
{"Output": "00:01:49, 00:01:01, 00:01:35"}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The tool has returned three timestamps: 00:01:49, 00:01:01, and 00:01:35. The first timestamp (00:01:49) is likely the most relevant as it is closest to the original timestamp (00:01:47) mentioned in the transcript when Lara got out.",
"Thought": "I will use the query_GPT4_Vision tool to analyze the 10-second clip centered around the first timestamp (00:01:49). This will help me understand what the wicketkeeper did after catching the ball.",
"Action":

"tool_name": "query_GPT4_Vision",

"timestamp": "00:01:49",
"query": "These are the still frames from a short video clip. Can you describe what the wicketkeeper is doing after catching the ball?"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "The wicketkeeper, after catching the ball, proceeds to celebrate by jumping into the air with a raised fist, exhibiting a gesture of victory or accomplishment. Subsequently, the wicketkeeper is seen with a teammate, and both appear to be exchanging congratulatory gestures, likely indicating the successful completion of a play, such as a dismissal."}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "According to the output from the query_GPT4_Vision tool, after catching the ball, the wicketkeeper celebrates by jumping into the air with a raised fist. He then exchanges congratulatory gestures with a teammate, indicating the successful completion of a play, likely a dismissal.",
"Thought": "The output from the query_GPT4_Vision tool provides a clear answer to the user's question. There is no need for further investigation.",
"Answer": "After catching the ball, the wicketkeeper celebrated by jumping into the air with a raised fist. He then exchanged congratulatory gestures with a teammate, indicating the successful completion of a dismissal."

Critic Feedback:
{"Critic Feedback": {"Criteria 1": "The user query appears to be fully answered. The agent provided a descriptive account of the wicketkeeper\u2019s actions post-catch, which aligns with the actions depicted in the provided video frames.", "Criteria 2": "The reasoning chain used by the agent was comprehensive. It appropriately started with the retrieval of the transcript of the video and then used the query_transcript tool to zero in on the moment of interest before using the query_GPT4_Vision tool with a clear query to obtain a description of the actions following the catch. The steps were logical and relevant to the user's question.", "Criteria 3": "There were no hallucinations present in the analysis. The tool outputs correspond accurately with the actual content of the images, which depict a celebration after a wicket in a cricket match."}}
