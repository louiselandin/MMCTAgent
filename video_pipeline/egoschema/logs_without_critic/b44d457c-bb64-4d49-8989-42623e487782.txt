User Input:
Question: Describe the main objective and repetitive actions c performs throughout the video. focus on the purpose of these actions and how they relate to each other.
Option 0: C is trying to clean the book.
Option 1: C is trying to read the book.
Option 2: C is trying to write in the book.
Option 3: C is trying to hide the book.
Option 4: C is trying to destroy the book.
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The user wants to know the main objective and repetitive actions of the camera wearer (C) in the video. The options suggest that C is interacting with a book in some way. The actions could be cleaning, reading, writing, hiding, or destroying the book.",
"Thought": "I need to find frames where C is interacting with a book. I can use the query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool with a query like 'C with a book' to find these frames. Then, I can use the query_GPT4_Vision tool to understand the actions of C in these frames.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"frames_query":"C with a book"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "00:01:58, 00:02:09, 00:02:33"}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The tool has returned three timestamps where C is likely interacting with a book. These timestamps are 00:01:58, 00:02:09, and 00:02:33.",
"Thought": "I should now use the query_GPT4_Vision tool to understand what C is doing with the book in these frames. I will start with the first timestamp, 00:01:58. I will ask the tool to describe the activity in these frames.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_GPT4_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"timestamp":"00:01:58", 
"query":"These are the still frames from a short video clip. Describe the activity in these frames."
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "The still frames from the video clip depict a person engaged in sorting or organizing books. Here's a more detailed description based on each frame:\n\n1. The person appears to be sitting on the floor with books scattered around. They are holding a book with a red cloth over their head, possibly wiping sweat away or using it as a mask.\n\n2. The person seems to be examining a book closely, holding it open in their hands.\n\n3. The individual continues to hold a book open, perhaps reading or looking for specific information.\n\n4. The person appears to be flipping through the pages of the book quite rapidly.\n\n5. The individual holds the book open while glancing down at the pages, maintaining the same activity.\n\n6. Once again, the red cloth is brought to the person's face, which could indicate wiping or adjusting the cloth.\n\n7. The person holds the book in one hand and the cloth in the other, possibly about to clean the book or use the cloth for another purpose.\n\n8. The individual is placing a book down onto a stack beside them, likely organizing their collection.\n\n9. The person's hands are moving in a blurred motion, indicating quick movement, possibly rearranging or sorting the books.\n\n10. Finally, the person is opening another book, likely to read, inspect, or place into the organized pile.\n\nThroughout the sequence, the person appears to be focused on books \u2013 they might be cleaning, organizing, reading brief sections, or sorting them into piles. The floor is strewn with other books and some framed items, suggesting that the activity is taking place in a personal space dedicated to reading or studying."}

"Observation": "The output from the query_GPT4_Vision tool suggests that C is engaged in sorting or organizing books. They are seen sitting on the floor with books scattered around, examining a book closely, flipping through the pages, and placing a book onto a stack beside them. They also use a red cloth, possibly to wipe sweat or as a mask, and at one point, they seem to be about to clean a book with it.",
"Thought": "Based on this output, it seems that C is not just reading the book but also organizing and possibly cleaning them. However, to confirm this, I should check the other timestamps as well. Next, I will use the query_GPT4_Vision tool with the second timestamp, 00:02:09.",

"Observation": "The tool query_GPT4_Vision has returned an error for the timestamp 00:02:09.",
"Thought": "Since the tool has returned an error for the timestamp 00:02:09, I should try the next timestamp, 00:02:33, to gather more information about C's actions.",

{"Output": "Error"}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The tool query_GPT4_Vision has returned an error for the timestamp 00:02:33 as well.",
"Thought": "Since the tool has returned an error for both the second and third timestamps, I will have to rely on the information I have from the first timestamp to answer the question. Based on that information, it seems that C is not just reading the book but also organizing and possibly cleaning them.",
"Answer": "Option 0: C is trying to clean the book."
