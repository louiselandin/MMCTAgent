However, given the nature of the question, it is highly unlikely that the video will contain this specific statistic unless it is a video about Neymar's career.

{"Output": "Based on the team kits and the context provided, it appears Neymar is playing against or scoring a goal against the following teams:\n\n1. In the images featuring the green and white striped kits, the team is Real Betis. This can be identified by their distinctive kit, which is historically linked to the club.\n\n2. In the images with the white kit featuring a red stripe, the team is Sevilla FC. The acronym 'SEV' on the scoreboard also corresponds to Sevilla FC.\n\n3. The team featured in the last image, where the scoreboard reads \"FCB 2 - 1 VIL,\" is Villarreal CF, as indicated by the abbreviation 'VIL' for the opposing team."}
