{"Output": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120\nHi, I'm Christy with Duck Brand Duct Tape. Today I'm going to show you how to make\n\n2\n00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,720\na holiday tree ornament. This is an advanced craft that should take about\n\n3\n00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:16,400\n45 minutes to complete. The materials you need for this project are green, red, and\n\n4\n00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,400\nchrome duct tape, a green pipe cleaner,\n\n5\n00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:28,360\nposter board, and scissors. For the first step, take your poster board and wrap it\n\n6\n00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:34,560\ninto a small cone that will be the shape of your holiday tree. And then cut along\n\n7\n00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,840\nthe bottom so you have a flat surface, which actually is about the size of this right\n\n8\n00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,360\nhere. And I've already gone ahead and covered the entire cone with green duct\n\n9\n00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,240\ntape. Next, we are going to make the duct tape loops that are the branches on your\n\n10\n00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:57,240\ntree. So again, I'm working with green and I'm going to pull off about 12 inches of\n\n11\n00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:05,440\nduct tape and lay it sticky side up, flat on your cutting board. I'm going to rip the\n\n12\n00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:11,080\nsame amount of tape, again about 12 inches, and I'm going to lay it sticky side to\n\n13\n00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:16,919\nsticky side to create a duct tape fabric. I'm going to trim the edges off here\n\n14\n00:01:16,919 --> 00:01:23,720\nbecause my second piece was a little bit shorter. And now you have a two-sided\n\n15\n00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:28,800\nstrip of duct tape. And I'm going to cut this into thirds, so making two cuts, one\n\n16\n00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,199\nhere and one here. It's okay if they're not all perfectly even because we are\n\n17\n00:01:34,199 --> 00:01:38,160\ngoing to be folding them over and you won't notice anyways. So I'm taking my three\n\n18\n00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:43,599\nstrips and just stacking them on top of each other. And now I'm going to cut two-inch\n\n19\n00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:49,120\nsections of the strip to create the individual loops. I have now taken a piece\n\n20\n00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:55,919\nof duct tape about five inches long and ripped it into thirds. So I have it laying\n\n21\n00:01:55,919 --> 00:02:01,360\nsticky side up and I'm taking one of my two-inch pieces of double-sided tape that\n\n22\n00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:09,240\nwe just made and first laying it down about halfway through the middle of the\n\n23\n00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:16,600\ntape and then the bottom half right above it, still leaving a layer of adhesive on\n\n24\n00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:23,639\ntop running along. And we'll continue to do this, leaving a little bit of a gap in\n\n25\n00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:30,119\nbetween each of the pieces that you put on there, running all along to the end of\n\n26\n00:02:30,119 --> 00:02:36,039\nthe piece of tape. Now I have a couple of these completed so I'll start to show\n\n27\n00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:40,479\nyou how to actually apply it to the cone. And we're going to start at the bottom. So\n\n28\n00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:45,160\nlining up the bottom of the loop with the bottom of the tree, stick the tape on like\n\n29\n00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:50,520\nthat and work all the way around the bottom. I think that would be the easiest way. Once\n\n30\n00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,119\nyou reach the second layer, just like we've done in our sample, we overlaid the\n\n31\n00:02:55,119 --> 00:03:00,240\nloops in between the one that's right below it so you have a layered look. And I'm\n\n32\n00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,119\njust going to continue to do this until my entire cone is covered with loops. The\n\n33\n00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:10,320\nnext step is to create the hook where you can actually hang it on a tree. So I'm\n\n34\n00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,559\nstarting with a piece of pipe cleaner and I'm going to cut about four to five\n\n35\n00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:21,240\ninches off and going to fold it into a loop and just put it on top of the tree.\n\n36\n00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:26,440\nI've also already ripped off a small piece of duct tape and then ripped it in\n\n37\n00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,440\nhalf so it's a little bit thinner. And I'm just going to wrap this around and\n\n38\n00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,880\ntape the pipe cleaner to the top of the tree. I already went ahead and created\n\n39\n00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:41,360\nlittle ornaments that were just from a duct tape sheet that I cut out into\n\n40\n00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,279\nsquares. If you can't find a sheet or you don't have one, you can also just roll\n\n41\n00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:50,119\nout duct tape and use a crafting knife or scissors to cut the little pieces out.\n\n42\n00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:57,839\nI also actually made a star and I'm just sticking it to the top. And that's how\n\n43\n00:03:57,839 --> 00:03:59,600\nyou make a holiday tree ornament.\n\n\n\n"}
