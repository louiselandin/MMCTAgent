Option 0: C was cleaning the garage.
Option 1: One day, c was diligently organizing the cluttered garage space.
Option 2: Recently, c was diligently searching for something specific within the cluttered garage.
Option 3: Casually, c was taking a short break in the spacious garage.

GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The user is asking about the main activity of the camera wearer (C) in the garage and how it was being executed. The options suggest that C could be cleaning, organizing, searching for something, taking a break, or working on a wood project in the garage.",
"Thought": "To answer this question, I need to first identify the main activity of C in the garage. I can use the query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool to search for frames where C is in the garage. Based on the options, I can craft a search query like 'C in the garage' to get the relevant frames. Then, I can use the query_GPT4_Vision tool to analyze these frames and determine what C is doing in the garage.",

Tool Output:
{"Output": "The series of frames depict a woodworking activity, specifically the process of cutting a wooden plank using a machinery tool which appears to be a table saw or similar equipment.\n\n1. In the first frame, the person is preparing to cut the piece of wood, adjusting its position to feed it into the saw.\n2. In the subsequent frames, the wood is steadily pushed forward through the blade of the saw, which is not clearly visible, suggesting it might be encased or beneath the working surface.\n3. Progressively, the wooden board is fed through the saw, suggesting a cutting action is taking place, though the actual cut is not directly visible.\n4. Through the sequence, we can see the person's hands move the board forward, showing a methodical and careful advance to maintain safety and precision in the cut.\n5. The latter frames show the individual completing the cut, as the size of the visible board on the machine's surface reduces, indicating the cut portion is falling away or being removed from the other side.\n6. The final frames depict the aftermath of the cutting process, where the individual seems to be examining the freshly cut edge or possibly preparing for the next step in their woodworking project.\n\nThroughout the sequence, the frames are taken from an overhead perspective, probably from a camera mounted on the person's head or upper body, offering a point-of-view depiction of the woodworking process."}
GPT-4 Output:

"Observation": "The tool has successfully processed the request for the timestamp 00:02:29 and provided a detailed description of the activity in the frames. According to the tool, the frames depict a woodworking activity where a person is cutting a wooden plank using a machinery tool, possibly a table saw. The person is shown preparing to cut the wood, pushing it through the saw, and examining the freshly cut edge.",
"Thought": "Based on the tool's description, it seems that C was working on a wood project in the garage, which aligns with option 4. The detailed description of the woodworking process also suggests that the activity was being executed in different ways, as asked in the question.",
"Answer": "Option 4: C was working on a wood project in the garage."
