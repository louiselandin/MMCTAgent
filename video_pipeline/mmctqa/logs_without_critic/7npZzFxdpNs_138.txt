User Input:
When did they start playing slip and slide on the ground?
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The user is asking about a specific event in the video where the characters start playing 'slip and slide' on the ground. To answer this, I need to find the timestamp of this event.",
"Thought": "I should start by getting the transcript of the video to see if there is any mention of 'slip and slide' or any related event. If the transcript contains this information, I can directly answer the question. If not, I will need to use the other tools to analyze the video frames.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "get_transcript",
"tool_input": {}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": ""}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The transcript of the video is empty. This means that the video does not contain any spoken words or the audio is not clear enough to generate a transcript.",
"Thought": "Since the transcript is empty, I cannot use it to answer the user's question. I need to analyze the video frames to find the event where they start playing 'slip and slide'. I will use the query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool to find the relevant frames.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"frames_query": "slip and slide"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "00:01:01, 00:02:01, 00:01:33"}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool has returned three timestamps: 00:01:01, 00:02:01, and 00:01:33. These timestamps represent the top three frames that match with the query 'slip and slide'.",
"Thought": "I should start by analyzing the first timestamp (00:01:01) using the query_GPT4_Vision tool. This tool will allow me to verify the event and provide more details about it.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_GPT4_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"timestamp": "00:01:01",
"query": "These are the still frames from a short video clip. Can you describe what is happening, specifically if there is any 'slip and slide' activity?"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "The series of images depict a vibrant and chaotic scene consistent with a festival or outdoor event where there is a lot of movement and activity. In the second and subsequent images, it is evident that there is an area with muddy ground where people are engaging in what appears to be 'slip and slide' activity, as indicated by the presence of mud on their clothing and the active motions captured. Some individuals are shown in the process of falling or sliding in the mud, which suggests a playful and potentially intentional engagement in slipping and sliding."}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The output from the query_GPT4_Vision tool confirms that there is a 'slip and slide' activity happening at the timestamp 00:01:01. The description mentions a vibrant and chaotic scene of a festival or outdoor event where people are sliding in the mud.",
"Thought": "Given the output from the query_GPT4_Vision tool, it seems that the 'slip and slide' activity starts at the timestamp 00:01:01. This should be the answer to the user's question.",
"Answer": "They started playing 'slip and slide' on the ground at the timestamp 00:01:01."
