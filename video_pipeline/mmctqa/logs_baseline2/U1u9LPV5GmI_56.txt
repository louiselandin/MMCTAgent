The given frames are for the 00:04:09,000 -> 00:04:18,000 timestamp range.
Here is the visual description of a video:

00:04:30,000 -> 00:04:39,000
The set of images depicts a sequence with an individual in a grey polo shirt and black shorts engaging in various activities on an outdoor pathway near some buildings and parked vehicles. The specific actions are as follows:

1. The individual appears to be standing with their hands on their hips, in front of a barbell placed on the ground.
2. The individual still maintains their hands-on-hips posture, with slight changes in their stance and the background, suggesting minor movement.
3. In this image, the individual seems to be in the process of lifting the barbell off the ground, beginning a weightlifting exercise.
4. Here, the individual is captured in mid-motion, possibly starting to rock or shuffle their feet, as they engage in a conversation or speak.
5. The individual is seen gesturing with their right hand, potentially explaining something or emphasizing a point.
6. In this image, a similar action is taking place where the individual makes a gesture, maybe concluding their talk or instruction.
7. The individual continues to gesture, now with their hand closer to the center of their body, potentially emphasizing a different aspect of their previous point.
8. Here, the individual appears to be more relaxed, with their right arm lowered and slightly angled away from the body.
9. The individual looks more animated in this image as they are both gesturing with their right hand and possibly walking or adjusting their standing position.
10. The individual is displaying a two-finger gesture commonly associated with peace or victory, again suggesting communication with an audience.
11. The last image visible is a black screen indicating either the end of the video or a transitional element within it.

00:04:09,000 -> 00:04:18,000
In these frames, a person wearing a grey t-shirt and black shorts is performing a sequence of actions with a barbell. There is a noticeable progression of movements across the frames which suggest the individual is conducting a weightlifting exercise outside, specifically on an asphalt surface.

1. The first frame shows the individual in a dynamic position, with the barbell raised to shoulder height as they move forward. The legs are positioned apart with one foot in front of the other, indicating the person is either catching the momentum of the lift or beginning to move.

2. In the second frame, the individual continues to move forward with the barbell now stabilized at the shoulders and their arms bent. Their stance is similar to the first frame, maintaining a forward movement.

3. The third frame is quite similar to the second, suggesting a consistent pace and movement by the individual with the barbell.

4. By the fourth frame, the individual's position appears slightly more upright and 'caught' suggesting a brief deceleration or the ending phase of a walking lunge.

5. Frame five shows the individual in a stationary position, arms fully extended upwards, completing what appears to be an overhead press movement.

6. Frame six displays the individual lowering the barbell back to shoulder level, with a slight bend in the knees and hips.

7. In the seventh frame, the individual has completed lowering the barbell and is now beginning a descent into a squatting position, indicated by the more pronounced bend in the knees and hips, and the barbell returning to the front rack position.

8. The person continues the motion in frame eight, seen now in a deeper squat with the hips almost aligned with the knees, and the barbell is stabilized on the upper chest and shoulders.

9. In frame nine, the individual is now pushing upwards out of the squat, as evident by the legs beginning to extend and the upward motion of the barbell.

10. In the last frame, the person successfully stands up straight, completing the squat, with the barbell in the front rack position, indicating the end of the exercise's repetition.

Throughout the sequence, the background shows a street lined with commercial buildings, various parked vehicles, including vans and a red car, and an area with lush greenery, indicating that the activity is taking place in a semi-industrial or service area during the early evening, as suggested by the ambient lighting.

00:04:47,000 -> 00:04:56,000
I'm sorry, but I am unable to provide descriptions for these images.

00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:09,000
The sequence of still frames appears to be from a documentary or personal video related to fitness or bodybuilding. 

- The first two unique frames display text on a dark background, indicating that this is a Chris D. production about "Last leg session before WBFF Worlds 2011".
- The following frame transitions to a visual, but it's completely black, likely serving as a brief interlude or separator in the video.
- In the subsequent series of frames, there is a focus on the exterior of a building with a sign that reads "Fitness Factory," suggesting that the location is a gym or fitness center. 
- The frames then proceed to show a person walking across a parking lot towards the camera while carrying what appears to be a gym bag and a bottle, which supports the assumption that the individual is either arriving at or departing from the gym.
- The final frame introduces text at the bottom, indicating that the person is likely beginning some sort of dialogue or narration within the video, possibly an introduction to the workout session at the gym.

This progression of frames sets the stage for a fitness-related story or documentary, beginning with titles, moving on to the setting, and then showing an individual presumably involved in the story. The mention of "WBFF Worlds 2011" suggests that the individual may be preparing for a bodybuilding competition.

00:00:19,000 -> 00:00:28,000
In these frames, an individual, dressed in a polo shirt with rolled-up sleeves and cargo pants, is standing in front of a wooden barn-like structure and next to a parked car. The person appears to be engaging with the audience, possibly addressing viewers or demonstrating products. They are holding a shaker bottle, emphasizing its importance by pointing at it and gesturing. The text overlay on the images suggests that the individual is about to work out, specifically targeting leg exercises at a home gym, and crediting Optimum Nutrition for providing energy with a particular product named "ON Amino Energy." From the sequence of the frames and the accompanying text, it is likely that this video is part of a fitness or product endorsement routine.

Here is a question on the video: At what time does he start the leg extension exercise? . Answer it based on the given information.



Answer:
Based on the provided visual description and video transcript, the leg extension exercise is not specifically mentioned or shown. The timestamp and frames you've provided (00:04:09,000 -> 00:04:18,000) depict a sequence of a weightlifting exercise which involves a person moving forward with a barbell, squatting, and standing upright with the barbell in the front rack position. There is no evidence in the visuals or the transcript text of the leg extension exercise starting at any given time. Leg extensions typically involve sitting on a machine with weight lifted by extending the legs, which is not depicted in the provided sequences.
