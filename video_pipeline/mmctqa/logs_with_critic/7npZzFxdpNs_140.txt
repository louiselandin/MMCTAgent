User Input:
Which festival is the overall video about?
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The user wants to know about the festival that the video is about. To answer this, I need to understand the overall content of the video.",
"Thought": "The first step should be to get the transcript of the video. This will give me a general idea about the video content and might directly answer the user's question.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "get_transcript",
"tool_input": {}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": ""}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The transcript of the video is empty. This indicates that the video does not contain any spoken words or the audio is not clear enough to be transcribed.",
"Thought": "Since the transcript is empty, the information about the festival must be present in the visuals. I should use the query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool to search for visuals related to festivals.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"frames_query": "festival"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "00:01:42, 00:02:39, 00:01:24"}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The tool has returned three timestamps where visuals related to a festival were detected. These timestamps are likely to contain the information about the festival that the video is about.",
"Thought": "I should use the query_GPT4_Vision tool to analyze the visuals at these timestamps. I will start with the first timestamp, which is the highest match to the search query.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_GPT4_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"timestamp": "00:01:42",
"query": "These are the still frames from a short video clip. Can you identify the festival that is being depicted in these frames?"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "The festival being depicted in these frames appears to be the Holi festival, also known as the \"festival of colors.\" This is indicated by the vibrant colored powders being thrown and smeared on participants, which is a traditional activity during Holi. The festival is widely celebrated in India and has also gained popularity in other parts of the world. It marks the arrival of spring and the victory of good over evil."}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The tool has identified the festival in the video as the Holi festival, also known as the \"festival of colors.\" This is based on the visuals of vibrant colored powders being thrown and smeared on participants, which is a traditional activity during Holi.",
"Thought": "The information provided by the tool is sufficient to answer the user's question. The festival that the video is about is the Holi festival.",
"Answer": "The video is about the Holi festival, also known as the \"festival of colors.\""
}
Critic Feedback:
{"Critic Feedback": {"Criteria 1": "The user query has been fully answered. The agent used the visuals from the video to identify the Holi festival accurately, which aligns well with the provided images.", "Criteria 2": "The reasoning chain was comprehensive: it first sought to answer the question using a transcript and, finding it lacking, proceeded to use visual tools to arrive at an answer. However, it did rely solely on the result from the first timestamp without considering the additional timestamps the Azure tool returned. Nevertheless, since the first timestamp was accurate, additional timestamps were seemingly unnecessary in this case.", "Criteria 3": "There are no hallucinations present in the reasoning chain. The conclusion that the video is about the Holi festival is supported by the visual information present in the images"}}
