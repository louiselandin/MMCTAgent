The given frames are for the 00:03:19,332 -> 00:03:28,041 timestamp range.
Here is the visual description of a video:

00:03:19,332 -> 00:03:28,041
The provided frames show a sequence that suggests a close-up shot of an individual transitioning to a wide shot of a natural landscape. The close-up detail is limited, but we observe parts of a person's attire such as what appears to be a grey piece of clothing and possibly the edge of a black cap.

The shift to the landscape reveals a dry, grassy field with shrubs and a few distant figures that appear to be people positioned near the center of the frame. They are too far away to be identified clearly. The environment gives the impression of a remote, natural setting with undulating terrain and no immediate signs of urban development.

00:02:42,562 -> 00:02:51,271
In the sequence of frames provided, we observe two individuals in an outdoor, natural setting, most likely on a hillside with grass and shrubs. Both are wearing headgear and backpacks, indicating that they could be involved in an outdoor activity like hiking or trekking.

In the first few frames, one individual is seen holding a red object, which appears to be a flag or a part of gear, while navigating through high grass. As the sequence progresses, the focus continues on the individual holding the red object, with varying degrees of motion blur, suggesting movement through the terrain.

The backdrop is consistent, showing a wide-open landscape with hills in the distance under a clear sky, implying a favorable weather condition for outdoor activities. The terrain appears to be uneven and covered with vegetation, which is typical of natural trails.

By the last frame, the individual who was initially in the foreground moves out of the frame, indicating ongoing movement through the landscape, possibly descending the hillside or moving along a path that curves out of the camera's view. The overall impression given by the frames suggests a dynamic outdoor adventure in a natural, possibly remote location.

00:02:28,048 -> 00:02:36,757
The sequence of frames depicts someone in a natural, grassy environment with rocky outcrops and shrubs. In the first few images, the individual is seen positioned in the landscape with what appears to be a long object held vertically in one hand, possibly a walking stick or a piece of equipment. As the frames progress, the scenery does not change significantly, indicating that the person might be standing still or moving slowly.

Next, the images shift to a close-up of the individual's upper body. While the face is blurred and not visible, one can observe that the person is wearing what looks like a baseball cap and a collared, zip-up jacket. The background reveals a blurred, natural setting with hints of greenery, suggesting that the person remains in the same outdoor environment throughout the series of images. Lastly, there's an observable change in the orientation of the person's head from one side to another, and the mouth seems to be open as if the person is speaking or reacting to something, but without facial details, the exact expression or emotions cannot be determined.

00:03:25,138 -> 00:03:33,847
In the sequence of frames provided, the first two images are unclear close-up views that don't offer much context. However, starting from the third frame, we see what appears to be a natural, outdoor setting with a focus on a rocky foreground and a field or grassland in the background. In the middle distance, there are two individuals riding bicycles across the field, seemingly following a trail or path. This activity continues across the subsequent frames, with the camera maintaining its focus on the cyclists as they move through the landscape, albeit the view is partially obscured by the rocky outcrop in the foreground.

As the frames progress, it becomes clear that the camera's perspective is from behind or within some shrubs or bushes, as vegetation partially obstructs the view in the foreground. The framing suggests that a nature-focused activity is being captured, possibly for a documentary or outdoor adventure footage. The vegetation rustles slightly, indicating light movement, perhaps by the wind or by the camera shifting very slightly, and adds a dynamic layer to the otherwise serene setting. The cyclists continue on their path, getting progressively smaller in the frame, implying they are moving away from the camera's position.

00:00:53,220 -> 00:01:01,929
The sequence of still frames depicts a transition from one subject to another. The first six frames capture a person in an outdoor setting. The person seems to be in motion, possibly gesturing with their hands as indicated by the varying positions of their hands and arms.

In the shift from the sixth to the seventh frame, the focus changes dramatically from the person to a scene that features what appears to be a dusty or smoky trail in a natural environment. The last four frames focus solely on this trail, showing a gradual change in perspective and the increased visibility of a large tree, which becomes more central in the frame. The trail itself seems to run from the foreground to the middle of the frames, slightly curving as it disappears into the distance.

As there is no movement conveyed in the natural setting due to the static nature of the stills, any specific activity occurring there is not depicted or discernible from these images.



Here is the video transcript:

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Now, we saw a ton of deer that afternoon and early the next morning and actually got a

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,960
couple opportunities to get close, but Pete really never found another deer he got excited

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,719
about until about 10 o'clock on the second morning and we came up on a cliff, almost

4
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:23,040
a canyon looking situation with scrub brush down below us and Pete found Whopper Daddy

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,360
bedded under a bush.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,520
It was the buck of my dreams.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,959
He was a 4x4 with brow tines and he had velvet.

8
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:34,040
I told Pete, I said, Pete, if I've got my choice, I want one that's got velvet and he

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,040
found it for me.

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:43,200
Now, it was just a matter of getting in on him.

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,880
One of the things I'd like to clarify is the fact that in the West, they judge antlers

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,680
a little different than we do.

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,880
You'll hear them say a 4x4 or a 3x3 and basically, they're counting points on each side.

14
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,000
A 4x4 would be an eastern 8 point.

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,240
So, when you're judging those animals and you hear them say a 4x4, to you and I, that's

16
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,239
an 8 pointer.

17
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,199
Now, I had read a little bit about stalking mule deer and I'd actually seen a couple of

18
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:14,720
television shows where guys had used a bow and gotten really close to a mule deer and

19
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,199
they all take off their boots and put on a heavy pair of socks and stalk that way and

20
00:01:20,199 --> 00:01:24,000
I kind of thought it was a joke and that was the first thing that Pete told me when we

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,879
started stalking on this mule deer was that we're going to take our boots off, put on

22
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,160
a heavy pair of socks and it'll really reduce our noise.

23
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,160
Well, the bad news is, is this is like desert country and you've got cactus and you've got

24
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,879
thistles and you've got yucca plants.

25
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:44,199
Everything that can stick or cut you is in the ground and the whole time you're walking,

26
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:45,199
you're feeling it.

27
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:51,000
So, it does cut down the noise, but boy, oh boy, is it hard on your feet.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,879
As soon as Pete saw this big buck behind the bush underneath, he motioned for me to crawl

29
00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:00,040
up so I eased up to the edge of the rim rock and I pulled my glasses up and I looked over

30
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,639
and I was pretty excited.

31
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:04,040
I mean, that was the deer that I really wanted.

32
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,199
Now, the problem was how to get to him and we felt like it was best to actually back

33
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,800
off the cliff and circle way downwind and try to come in at the exact same level of

34
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,839
the deer because we had a steep, steep bank, a steep canyon wall and then a flat bottom.

35
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:24,320
We felt like with the deer positioned behind that bush, we could use that bush as cover

36
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,919
and come in right from behind him.

37
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,559
The wind was right.

38
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:30,080
Everything seemed like it was going to be perfect to kill that deer.

39
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,839
Now, this was one of those stalks that seemed like it took four days.

40
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:39,720
We came all the way down and around, probably two or three hundred yards and then got down

41
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,240
on the flat and there wasn't a lot of cover so we were just picking and choosing our way

42
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:50,000
from bush to bush and basically, I'm trying to blend in behind Pete and I'm trying to

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,240
follow his body language and his cues.

44
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,199
When he hesitates, I need to stop.

45
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:58,320
When he kneels down, I kneel down and that's exactly what you have to do when you're with

46
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,479
a guide like that.

47
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:03,600
You have to let him cue you in on every movement you need to make.

48
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:10,559
The closer we got to the deer, it was becoming really obvious that that bush that was shielding

49
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:15,440
him from us, it kept him from being able to see us, but it made it extremely hard for

50
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,160
us to see him and more importantly, get a shot.

51
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,199
So we kept quartering left and right trying to jockey for position to where we could find

52
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:29,119
one little lane that might give me an opportunity so when he stood up to adjust or to eat a

53
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:31,639
little bit, that I could slide an arrow in there.

54
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:37,800
And we're inside of 40 yards this whole time and then 30 and then 25 and now I've got nowhere

55
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
else to go.

56
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,600
I can't bridge that gap any further and I've still got a screen of bushes in front of me.

57
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,039
I was at one of those positions where I just really didn't know what to do.

58
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:53,639
Pete actually sent me in that last 5 or 10 yards to get me inside a bow range and I kept

59
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:58,880
looking back, really like a big brother, man I need some direction, what do I do?

60
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,960
And he and I both kind of saw the opportunity at the same time.

61
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,279
There was like one little lane that fed right up to where the deer was bedded.

62
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:11,440
He was actually pawed in and dug down into the dirt and Pete and I decided that we were

63
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,679
going to kind of get together and slide up into that lane and then set up a shooting

64
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:17,720
position to where we could take the shot.

65
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:23,880
The bad news is that when we made that move, there must have just been enough open between

66
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:31,279
the deer's eye and us to give him that visual on us and man, he was gone and I mean gone.

67
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,040
When they see you or when they smell you, there's no hesitation.

68
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,959
They are out of dodge.

69
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:44,239
One of the things that I had the most difficulty getting used to being from the east was the

70
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:47,119
amount of glassing that goes into hunting a mule deer.

71
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:51,880
You're constantly with your spotting scope or with your binoculars looking for deer.

72
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,440
Back home, if you can see a deer 75 to 100 yards away, that's a long ways.

73
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,119
You rarely ever use binoculars.

74
00:04:58,119 --> 00:05:03,119
These guys live with them on their chest and it's so important to have good optics and

75
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:07,760
be able to see those deer a long ways away and pick your opportunities.

76
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:14,600
We continued to see so many mule deer and actually had stalks every day on beautiful,

77
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,480
beautiful bucks in decent spots, but there's so many variables to archery hunting.

78
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,720
With gun hunting, you can sit back there at 100, 150 yards, get in position and make the

79
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,880
shot, but with bow hunting, everything's got to be right.

80
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,880
You've got to be inside of 40 yards and you've got to have a clean area to the vitals and

81
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,119
I would get into situations where they would see me moving or maybe where the wind would

82
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:44,119
get me and I was in situations where one time, I was on a canyon cliff above a big mule deer

83
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:50,440
and I got so close to the deer that I could peek over and I could see the tips of his

84
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,320
feet and I could hear him belching.

85
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,040
I was four yards from that deer and I still could not get an arrow into it.

86
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,200
Tried to wait him out and eventually, that little freaky gust of wind came and boom,

87
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,320
he was out of there.

88
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,399
You might kind of think that was funny watching me run across the ridge in my little white

89
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:12,200
socks trying to get a shot at that deer as he goes down the backside, but by that time,

90
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,480
I was pretty darn frustrated.

Here is a question on the video: When does the narrator describe, being 4 yards away from a deer?. Answer it based on the given information.



Answer:
The narrator describes being 4 yards away from a deer in the transcript at 00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:52,320. Here, the narrator recounts a close encounter with a mule deer, where he was so near he could see the deer's feet and hear it, despite being unable to get an arrow in for a shot.
