User Input:
Which dance move is done as well mentioned in the video?
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The user is asking about a specific dance move that is both performed and mentioned in the video. To answer this question, I need to analyze both the transcript and the visuals of the video.",
"Thought": "First, I will get the transcript of the video to see if any dance moves are mentioned. If the transcript contains the name of a dance move, I will then need to verify if that move is also performed in the video.",
