User Input:
What is added to the mixture of vinegar and food colorant?
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The user is asking about a specific event in the video where something is added to a mixture of vinegar and food colorant. This seems to be a specific event in the video and hence we need to find out when and where this happens.",
"Thought": "Since the user query is about a specific event, we should first check the transcript to see if there is any mention of this event. If the event is mentioned in the transcript, we can use that information to guide our visual analysis.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "get_transcript",
"tool_input": 
{
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": ""}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The transcript of the video is empty. This means that the video does not contain any spoken words or the audio was not transcribed.",
"Thought": "Since the transcript is empty, we cannot use it to guide our visual analysis. We need to directly analyze the visuals to answer the user query. We can use the query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool to find the frames where vinegar and food colorant are present, and then use the query_GPT4_Vision tool to analyze those frames and find out what is added to the mixture.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"frames_query": "mixture of vinegar and food colorant"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "00:01:08, 00:00:26, 00:00:50"}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool has returned three timestamps: 00:01:08, 00:00:26, and 00:00:50. These are the top three frames that match with the query 'mixture of vinegar and food colorant'.",
"Thought": "We should now analyze these frames using the query_GPT4_Vision tool to find out what is added to the mixture of vinegar and food colorant. We will start with the highest match, which is the timestamp 00:01:08.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_GPT4_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"timestamp": "00:01:08",
"query": "These are the still frames from a short video clip. What is being added to the mixture of vinegar and food colorant?"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "Error"}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "There was an error in processing the request with the query_GPT4_Vision tool. This could be due to various reasons such as a problem with the video clip at the specified timestamp.",
"Thought": "Since there was an error with the timestamp 00:01:08, we should try the next timestamp, which is 00:00:26.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_GPT4_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"timestamp": "00:00:26",
"query": "These are the still frames from a short video clip. What is being added to the mixture of vinegar and food colorant?"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "It appears that baking soda is being added to the mixture of vinegar and food colorant. The addition of baking soda to vinegar is a classic acid-base reaction, which often results in the effervescence or fizzing as carbon dioxide gas is produced. Unfortunately, in the provided frames, there is no visual evidence of the actual addition of baking soda\u2014no spoon or hand is shown adding it, and there is no visible change in the mixture that would confirm this addition. However, given the context and typical science demonstrations, baking soda is a common substance combined with vinegar and food coloring for a chemical reaction experiment."}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The query_GPT4_Vision tool suggests that baking soda is being added to the mixture of vinegar and food colorant. However, it also mentions that there is no visual evidence of the actual addition of baking soda in the provided frames. The tool is making an educated guess based on the context and typical science demonstrations.",
"Thought": "Given the output from the query_GPT4_Vision tool, it seems likely that baking soda is being added to the mixture. However, since the tool mentioned that there is no visual evidence of the actual addition of baking soda in the provided frames, it might be a good idea to verify this by analyzing the third timestamp (00:00:50) as well.",
"Action":
{
"tool_name": "query_GPT4_Vision",
"tool_input": 
{
"timestamp": "00:00:50",
"query": "These are the still frames from a short video clip. What is being added to the mixture of vinegar and food colorant?"
}
}
}
Tool Output:
{"Output": "Baking soda is being added to the mixture of vinegar and food colorant."}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The query_GPT4_Vision tool confirms that baking soda is being added to the mixture of vinegar and food colorant in the frames around the timestamp 00:00:50.",
"Thought": "With this confirmation, we can confidently answer the user's question. The substance that is added to the mixture of vinegar and food colorant in the video is baking soda.",
"Answer": "Baking soda is added to the mixture of vinegar and food colorant in the video."
