User Input:
Give me a list of ingredients to use, along with their quanities
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The user is asking for a list of ingredients and their quantities. This seems like a question that could be answered by the transcript if the video is a cooking tutorial or something similar. However, without any specific context or dish mentioned, it's hard to determine what ingredients the user is referring to.",
"Thought": "The first step should be to get the transcript of the video to see if it contains any mention of ingredients and their quantities.",

Tool Output:
{"Output": ""}
GPT-4 Output:
{
"Observation": "The transcript of the video is empty. This implies that the video does not contain any spoken words or the audio was not captured. Therefore, we cannot extract any information about ingredients and their quantities from the transcript.",
"Thought": "Since the transcript is empty, the information might be present in the visuals of the video. We can use the query_frames_Azure_Computer_Vision tool to search for visuals of ingredients and their quantities. The search query can be 'ingredients' as it is a general term that might cover a wide range of possible visuals related to cooking or food preparation.",

"Thought": "We should now use the query_GPT4_Vision tool to analyze the visuals at these timestamps. We will start with the first timestamp (00:00:19) as it is the highest match to the search query.

Tool Output:
{"Output": "Unfortunately, the still frames provided are either too blurry or do not contain enough visual information to accurately describe the ingredients and their quantities.\n\nThe first three images are very blurry, depicting a rapid motion, such as someone moving their hands possibly during a mixing action, but no specific ingredients can be distinguished.\n\nThe fourth and fifth images show the word \"Ingredients\" written on a white background, but no physical ingredients are visible.\n\nThe sixth through tenth images depict a sequence where a clear liquid from a bottle with a red cap is being poured into a clear glass jar. In the ninth image, text is overlaid that reads \"Some Vinegar...\", indicating that the clear liquid is vinegar. However, the exact quantity of vinegar cannot be determined from these images because the frames don't include a measurement or provide enough context to estimate the volume.\n\nWithout additional frames or clearer images, I cannot provide a more precise description of the ingredients or their quantities."}

"Observation": "The query_GPT4_Vision tool was unable to provide a clear description of the ingredients and their quantities from the frames at the timestamp 00:00:19. The frames were either too blurry or did not contain enough visual information. However, it was able to identify that vinegar was being poured into a jar, but the exact quantity could not be determined.",
"Thought": "Since the first timestamp did not provide enough information, we should proceed to analyze the visuals at the next timestamp (00:01:06) using the query_GPT4_Vision tool.

Tool Output:
{"Output": "The sequence of images you've provided shows the process of combining food coloring with vinegar, although the specific quantity of each ingredient isn't specified in the written note or clearly visible in the images. Here's a recap based on the visible content:\n\n1. The initial images show a clear glass containing a yellow-amber liquid, which is likely to be vinegar. The quantity is not visually measured, but the glass is less than half full. It appears to be a standard drinking glass, which can typically hold between 8 to 16 ounces (237 to 473 milliliters) when full.\n\n2. A note in the latter images states \"Mix food colorant with vinegar,\" indicating the intent to combine these two substances.\n\n3. The final images show the addition of a red substance, which is the food coloring, to the vinegar in the glass. Since the actual process of pouring isn't visible, the quantity added is difficult to determine, but it appears to be a small amount, as is typical with food coloring because it's highly concentrated.\n\n4. The red food coloring begins to disperse in the vinegar, creating swirls and eventually will mix more thoroughly if stirred or allowed to sit.\n\nFor exact quantities and further details about the mixing process, more information or a clearer visual reference would be necessary, such as measuring utensils or the original containers with labels showing volume or weight."}

"Thought": "We have some information about the ingredients and their approximate quantities, but it's not exact.

Tool Output:
{"Output": "Based on the still frames you have provided, the following ingredients and their quantities can be identified:\n\n1. Two spoons of flour: This is shown in the second and third frames, where the text above the bowl reads \"Two spoons of flour,\" and we can see a white powdery substance in the bowl, believed to be flour.\n\n2. One spoon of food coloring: This is indicated in the frames from six to ten, where the text \"One spoon of food colorant\" is visible, and a red liquid is shown inside the bowl. The liquid is consistent with the appearance of red food coloring.\n\nSince the still frames are selective and do not show the process of adding the ingredients, these are the only ingredients and quantities I can confirm from the provided images."}

{
"Observation": "The query_GPT4_Vision tool has provided a description of the ingredients and their quantities visible in the frames at the timestamp 00:00:48. The frames show two spoons of flour and one spoon of food coloring being used.",
"Thought": "We now have information about several ingredients and their quantities from different parts of the video: vinegar (quantity not specified), food coloring (small amount), two spoons of flour, and one spoon of food coloring. This information should be sufficient to answer the user's question.",
"Answer": "Based on the visuals from the video, the following ingredients and their quantities are used: an unspecified quantity of vinegar, a small amount of food coloring, two spoons of flour, and one spoon of food coloring. Please note that these quantities are approximate as the video did not provide exact measurements."

Critic Feedback:
{"Critic Feedback": {"Criteria 1": "The final answer does provide a list of ingredients with their quantities; however, the quantities mentioned are not precise but estimated. For a complete answer, it would have been beneficial if the agent had access to more detailed visuals or textual information on the measurements.", "Criteria 2": "The reasoning chain performed thorough analysis given the limitations of the empty transcript and relied on visual information. It sequentially examined the frames from the timestamps provided by Azure Computer Vision, which is commendable. However, a suggestion for improvement could be to consider the utility of additional queries that might refine the search for more precise quantities if possible.", "Criteria 3": "There is no evidence of hallucinations in the agent's log. The outcome seems consistent with the images provided, and the agent responsibly qualified that the quantities were approximate due to the lack of precision in the visuals."}}
